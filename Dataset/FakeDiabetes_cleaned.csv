promoting effects alternative before it 's news. ,promoted for decades as safe sugar alternative presumably to prevent or reduce symptoms of diabetes splenda sucralose has been found to have diabetes promoting effects in human subjects. artificial sweetener sucralose which is approximately 600 times sweeter than sucrose table sugar and marketed under variety of brand names such as splenda cukren nevella and sucraplus has recently been found to have diabetes promoting effects in human test subjects despite containing no calories and being classified as nonutritive sweetener. study published in journal diabetes care lead by researchers at center for human nutrition washington university school of medicine st. louis missouri set out to test metabolic effects of sucralose in obese subjects who did not use nonnutritive sweeteners. seventeen subjects underwent 5-hour oral glucose tolerance test on two separate occasions preceded by consuming either sucralose experimental condition or water control condition 10 min before glucose load in randomized crossover design. results were reported as follows in other words single dose of sucralose lead to .6 mmol l increase in plasma glucose concentrations 20 increase in insulin levels 22 greater peak insulin secretion rate and 7 decrease in insulin clearance indication of decreased insulin sensitivity. despite fact that preapproval research on sucralose found wide range of adverse health effects in exposed animals see bitter truth about splenda national and international food safety regulatory bodies including fda now consider it completely safe for daily human consumption. same applies for synthetic sweeteners like aspartame which despite its well known link with brain damage and over 40 documented adverse health effects is safety approved in 90 nations. industry influence largely accounts for fact that synthetic chemicals like aspartame neotame saccharin and sucralose are being foisted onto public as safe non calorie sweeteners despite obvious research to contrary and fact that stevia non calorie natural alternative has over 1500 years of documented safe use. american diabetes association ada for instance does nothing to hide its explicit partnership with mcneil nutritionals maker of splenda despite obvious conflict of interest. on its website ada describes mcneil nutritionals as national strategic partner and lauds them as committed to helping people and their families with diabetes by focusing on overall nutritional needs of diabetes community. mcneil nutritionals sponsors adas recipe of day along with variety of educational tools and information for consumers and healthcare professionals. despite these cozy relationships research on sucraloses adverse health effects continues to accumulate.

pancreatic cancer health before it 's news. ,experts have revealed onset of diabetes or existing diabetes getting much worse could be sign of hidden pancreatic cancer reports daily express. media reports follow press release of study presented at european cancer congress ecco yesterday. research analysed nearly million people with type 2 diabetes in belgium and italy some of whom went on to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. recent onset of diabetes appeared to be possible warning sign of pancreatic cancer with 25 of cases in belgium and 18 in italy being diagnosed within three months of diabetes diagnosis. faster progression of diabetes where patients needed insulin or other more intensive treatments sooner was also associated with greater chance of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. pancreatic cancer is rare and often has poor outcome partly because it is difficult to detect at early stage. however its important to put these findings in context. diabetes has previously been linked with pancreatic cancer though it is unclear why. it could be that diabetes increases risk of pancreatic cancer. what is probably more likely is that rapid onset or progression of diabetes could be symptom of cancer itself. diabetes is fairly common in uk with around 4 million cases while pancreatic cancer remains very rare. just because you have diabetes does not mean you will go on to get pancreatic cancer. however if you are concerned that you may have diabetes or that your diabetes is poorly controlled you should talk to your gp. there are also steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing diabetes. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from international prevention research institute in lyon france. study has not yet been published in journal but was presented at european cancer congress held in amsterdam. findings come from press release. funding was provided by sanofi french pharmaceutical company. authors declare sponsor had no influence on study design conduct analysis and reporting. this has been reported widely in uk media though not always accurately. mail online claims researchers analysed nearly million type 2 diabetics in italy and belgium who had been told they had pancreatic cancer however this was number of people in database with diabetes. only 2.757 people had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. moreover daily telegraph reports 50 per cent of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes previous year. this is rather misleading and suggests 50 of all people with pancreatic cancer also have diabetes. but this study only looked at people with diabetes. of those who developed pancreatic cancer half had received their diabetes diagnosis in past year. overall proportion of all people with pancreatic cancer who also have diabetes in population is unknown. what kind of research was this. this was retrospective cohort study looking at association between type 2 diabetes and diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. study is currently only available as published abstract and was presented at european cancer congress with accompanying press release. full study publication is not available so we ca nt fully critique methods and analysis. pancreatic cancer has notoriously poor prognosis as it is often hard to diagnose at early stage due to lack of symptoms or non specific symptoms. individual outcomes vary but generally only 1 of all people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer live for more than 10 years after their diagnosis. diabetes has already been linked as possible risk factor for pancreatic cancer but in what context is uncertain. however onset of diabetes or rapid deterioration of current diabetes could be possible marker for early pancreatic cancer so could potentially aid earlier diagnosis. what did research involve. researchers used prescription database inter mutualist agency aim ima to identify 368.377 people receiving treatment for type 2 diabetes in belgium between 2008 and 2013. they also identified 456.311 being treated in lombardy italy between 2008 and 2012. these data were linked to pancreatic cancer data from belgium cancer registry and hospital discharge databases in lombardy. rates of pancreatic cancer were analysed in association with time of first prescription of diabetes drugs and use of different diabetes treatments. what were basic results. in belgium 885 of 368.377 people with diabetes had pancreatic cancer. in lombardy 1.872 of 456.311 people with diabetes had pancreatic cancer. among all those with pancreatic cancer in two regions 50 had been diagnosed within one year of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. in belgium 25 of pancreatic cancer cases were diagnosed within 90 days and in lombardy 18 were diagnosed within 90 days. when considering treatment researchers generally found that switching to more intensive diabetes treatments was also linked with greater risk of pancreatic cancer diagnosis people who switched from oral diabetes drugs to more intensive treatment of incretin based therapy injected drugs that help body produce more insulin had 3.3 times risk 95 confidence interval ci 2.0 to 5.5 of cancer diagnosis in following three months. this decreased to around two fold risk for 3 to 6 months after first prescription of incretin drugs hazard ratio hr 2.3 95 ci 1.2 to 4.7 and again for 6 to 12 months after first prescription hr 2.1 95 ci 1.2 to 3.9. switch from oral diabetes drugs or incretin to insulin injections was also linked with increased risk of pancreatic cancer hr 11.9 95 ci 10.4 to 13.6. when comparing those who developed pancreatic cancer with those who remained cancer free switching from oral diabetes drugs to incretin or insulin injections happened sooner after diabetes diagnosis in those who developed cancer median 372 days to switch to incretins and 315 days to switch to insulin in those who developed cancer versus median 594 days to switch to incretins and 437 days to switch to insulin. how did researchers interpret results. lead researcher commented there is currently no good non invasive method for detecting pancreatic cancer that is not yet showing any visible signs or symptoms. we hope that our results will encourage search for blood markers indicating presence of pancreatic cancer which could guide decisions to perform confirmation examination like endoscopy. this study uses large prescription database to investigate link between diabetes and pancreatic cancer looking at timing of first diabetes prescription and change in drugs prescribed. among people with type 2 diabetes diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was linked with recent onset of diabetes or rapidly deteriorating diabetes. this suggests these could both be potential warning signs of hidden pancreatic cancer and indicate need for more investigations. while diabetes has previously been linked with pancreatic cancer nature of cause and effect relationship remains unclear. it could be that diabetes increases risk of cancer or it could be that recent onset or deterioration of diabetes is symptom of cancer. it had also previously been thought that incretin therapies could promote pancreatic cancer. however it could be that incretin therapies and insulin therapies are often prescribed sooner in patients who have undiagnosed pancreatic cancer. as authors make clear it is probably pancreatic cancer that causes deterioration of diabetes. limitation of this study is that it was carried out in two specific areas in europe. sociodemographic variations in diabetes or cancer prevalence medical care or risk factors may mean results are not fully applicable to uk. findings are also based on prescription database so only look at raw data on numbers. researchers have nt delved further into nature of individual diabetes and cancer diagnoses investigations and treatment. these are early findings presented at conference. full published study is not available so it is not possible to analyse methods and possible implications further. its not possible to say whether findings could lead to more in depth investigation of people with newly diagnosed or rapidly progressing diabetes or whether this could make earlier pancreatic cancer diagnosis and improved survival rates possible. pancreatic cancer symptoms diabetes

are bad sugar is toxic century of misunderstanding causes of obesity and diabetes health before it 's news. ,carbs are bad sugar is toxic century of misunderstanding causes of obesity and diabetes if excerpts below seem interesting read even more at full original article reviewing over century of german and american research and theories here population wide explosions in prevalence of obesity along with increases in occurrence of diabetes that frankly strain imagination disease that leads to blindness kidney failure amputation heart disease and premature death and that was virtually non existent in hospital inpatient records from mid-19th century now afflicts one in 11 americans in some populations as many as one in two adults are diabetic. in midst of such public health crisis obvious question to ask is why. many reasons can be imagined for any public health failure but we have no precedents for failure of this magnitude. as such simplest explanation is that were not targeting right agent of disease that our understanding of aetiology of both obesity and diabetes is somehow flawed perhaps tragically so. its quite possible that causes are misunderstood. history of obesity and nutrition research suggests that this is indeed what has happened. in decades leading up to second world war german and austrian clinical investigators had concluded that common obesity was clearly caused by hormonal disturbance starting in the1960s other research would link that disturbance to sugar in our diets. but german and austrian thinking evaporated with war and possibility that sugar was to blame never took hold dismissed by nutrition community who by 1970s became fixated on dietary fat as trigger of our chronic diseases. now with explosion of epidemic and compelling new research its time to reconsider both our causal thinking on obesity and diabetes and possibility that sugar is playing critical role. who and other health organisations have recently taken to arguing that sugar and particularly sugary beverages should be taxed heavily or regulated. but they do so not because they say sugar causes disease using same definition of causality that we use when we say cigarettes cause lung cancer but rather because from their perspective sugar represents empty calories that we eat in excess. by this thinking we still get fatter because we eat too much or exercise too little. solution is to eat in moderation and consume sugar in moderation or balance it with more physical activity. energy balance paradigm implies that only way in which foods influence our body fat is through their energy content or calories that is through energy that we absorb without excreting and so make available to be oxidised or stored. this is only variable that matters. its implication of phrase calorie is calorie which by 1960s had become mantra of nutrition and obesity researchers evoked invariably to support dogma that only calories count when it comes to understanding and treating human obesity. this logic has been lifeblood of sugar industry. if sugar was uniquely toxic in that it possessed some special property that made us respond to it by accumulating fat or becoming diabetic then government health agencies would have to regulate it. if all sugar does is add calories to diet just as any other food does then it is in effect benign. when sugar industry embarked in 1956 on nationwide advertising offensive to knock down reports that sugar is fattening it did so on seemingly sound scientific basis that s]ugar is neither reducing food nor fattening food as industry advertisements explained. there are no such things. all foods supply calories and there is no difference between calories that come from sugar or steak or grapefruit or ice cream. thinking of obesity as energy balance disorder is as meaningless as calling poverty money balance problem even 60 years later in 2015 when new york times reported that academic researchers were doing bidding of coca cola by taking its money to fund global energy balance network and shift blame for obesity away from bad diets this was still logic invoked in sugars defence if you believe that obesity is caused by mere caloric surplus then solution to epidemic is not necessarily to avoid coca cola but to either consume it and everything else in moderation or to burn off excess calories with physical activity. for sugar industry and purveyors such as coca cola of sugar rich foods and beverages this remarkably resilient century old conception of why some of us get fat or are born fat and others do nt or are nt has been gift that keeps on giving. so heres another way to frame what is now imperative question is energy balance hypothesis of obesity correct. is it right paradigm to understand disorder. competing hypothesis has existed for over century in this paradigm obesity is not energy balance disorder but disorder of excess fat accumulation and so clearly hormonal and metabolic disorder result of endocrine disturbance as it was phrased in 1930s by eugene du bois then leading american authority on metabolism. by this logic foods we eat influence fat accumulation not because of their caloric content but because of their macronutrient content proteins fats and carbohydrates they contain. this paradigm attends to how organisms humans of course in particular orchestrate careful partitioning of macronutrient fuels they consume determining whether they will be burned for energy or stored or used to rebuild tissues and organs. it proposes that dysregulation of this exquisitely evolved finely tuned homeostatic system system that is biologically balanced is necessary component to explain both excessive storage of calories of fat obesity and diabetes that accompanies it. this alternate hypothesis implies that sugar has unique effects in human body leading directly to both diabetes and obesity independent of calories consumed. by this way of thinking refined sugars are indeed toxic albeit over course of years or decades. we get fat and diabetic not because we eat too much of them although that is implied tautologically merely by terms overconsumption and overeating but because they have unique physiological metabolic and hormonal effects that directly trigger these disorders. if all this is right then thinking of obesity as energy balance disorder is as meaningless as calling poverty money balance problem caused of course by earning too little or spending too much or both. by conceiving of obesity as problem caused by behaviours of excessive consumption and physical inactivity researchers not only took physiological defect excess accumulation of fat often to massive extent and turned it into behavioural problem. but they made critical error one that has grown over course of decades into idea that seems too big to fail. obesity was clearly not problem of energy balance but of fat trapping just as global warming is not energy balance problem but energy trapping one. question that had to be answered is why this trapping occurs. any viable hypothesis of obesity had to explain why fat tissue of obese is so avid in hoarding calories as fat rather than allowing that fat to be metabolised and provide energy for body. by 1930 julius bauer of university of vienna noted vienna authority on internal diseases as new york times called him had taken up von bergmanns ideas arguing that obesity had to result from dysregulation of biological factors that normally work to keep fat accumulation under check. bauer argued that fat cells are clearly being driven by these factors to hoard excessive calories as fat and this in turn would deprive rest of body of energy it needed to thrive. in this hormonal regulatory conception excessive fat accumulation causes hunger and physical inactivity not other way around. bauer likened fat tissue of obese person to that of malignant tumour or foetus uterus or breasts of pregnant woman all with independent agendas causing them to take up calories of fuel from circulation and hoard them or put them to localised use regardless of how much person might be eating or exercising. with obesity wrote bauer sort of anarchy exists adipose tissue lives for itself and does not fit into precisely regulated management of whole organism. obese animals would frequently manifest what newburgh might have described as perverted appetite technically hyperphagia as they grew fatter they would be exceedingly hungry and consume great amounts of food. but they would invariably get obese or at least significantly fatter even when they did nt eat any more or were nt allowed to eat any more than control animals often littermates that remained lean. some of these animals would remain excessively fat even as they were being starved. insulin partitions how we use fuels we consume it directs fat cells to store fat whatever defect or fundamental fault that caused these animals to accumulate excessive fat perverted appetite ie overeating could be ruled out. defect had to be working either to cause fat cells to hoard calories as fat or to suppress animals ability to burn fatty acids for fuel. or both. not until 1960s though would researchers elucidate basic mechanisms of fat accumulation. to do so required invention of technology that allowed researchers to accurately measure level of hormones circulating in bloodstream. this was work of rosalyn yalow medical physicist and solomon berson physician. when yalow was awarded nobel prize for work in 1977 by then berson was not alive to share it nobel foundation described it aptly as bringing about revolution in biological and medical research. those interested in obesity could now finally answer questions on which pre war european clinicians could only speculate what hormones regulate storage of fat in fat cells and its use for fuel by rest of body. answers began coming with very first publications out of yalow and bersons laboratory and were swiftly confirmed. as it turns out virtually all hormones work to mobilise fatty acids from fat cells so that they can then be used for fuel. one dominant exception to this fuel mobilisation signalling is insulin which partitions how we use fuels we consume in particular it directs fat cells to store fat while facilitating uptake and oxidation of glucose blood sugar by muscle and organ cells. in other words when insulin is secreted primarily in response to carbohydrates in our diet it directs our cells to burn carbohydrate as fuel and store fat. and so one biological factor necessary to mobilise fat from storage and have it used for fuel as yalow and berson suggested in 1965 is negative stimulus of insulin deficiency. put simply when insulin levels in circulation are elevated we store fat and use glucose for fuel as insulin levels drop fat is mobilized and we burn it instead. put more simply when we eat carbs especially sugar it raises insulin levels and tells out body to store fat. carbs are bad sugar is toxic level bad. if interested read even more at full original article here or read gary taubes

's news. ,when my mother got up into her 80s and 90s her greatest fear was that she would lose her memory. she never did. but for many seniors it happens. so many of us lose brain function as we age that alzheimers disease is sixth leading cause of death in u.s. medical community continues to look for chemical cure to alzheimers. acknowledging link between insulin resistance and onset of dementia diseases like alzheimers researchers have discovered that drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes have shown to reverse memory loss in mice. drugs known as triple receptor agonist drugs and sold under trade names byetta bydureon and victoza were injected daily in mice suffering from memory loss brain inflammation plaque formation and deteriorated synaptic functions signs and symptoms of alzheimers. in addition to increased memory function mice experienced reduced inflammation and improved synaptic functions. dr. doug brown director of research and development at alzheimers society said with no new treatments in nearly 15 years we need to find new ways of tackling alzheimers. its imperative that we explore whether drugs developed to treat other conditions can benefit people with alzheimers and other forms of dementia. this approach to research could make it much quicker to get promising new drugs to people who need them. what should be more imperative than finding chemical cocktails to treat dementia diseases like alzheimers is to acknowledge what prevents it and cures it. that s not drugs because alzheimers patients are nt suffering from want of drugs. they re suffering from insulin resistance brought on by diet. and that s where link between alzheimers and diabetes comes in. my friend and colleague dr. michael cutler calls insulin master hormone. excess insulin applies to all people and children too. its our diet. we shove so much sugar from our diet at our cells until they become insulin resistant. insulin ca nt get into our cells then trouble begins. in his book insulin factor dr. cutler writes that if your master hormone insulin is dysfunctional inadequate supply of insulin in your brain leads to degeneration of your brain cells. this in turn can contribute to dementia. studies show that people with lower levels of insulin receptors in their brains often have alzheimers. likewise studies show that chronic high levels of insulin and sugar may be toxic to brain cells. so healthy insulin response is key to nurturing healthy brain cells. when we acknowledge cause we can then prescribe cure. we know that type 2 diabetes can be cured by diet. its caused by diet. in type 2 diabetes pancreas makes enough insulin but blood sugar levels increase so that cell membranes are triggered to become insulin resistant. in response pancreas makes more insulin. over time insulin receptors in cell membranes begin to function abnormally. when blood sugar levels remain high all time damage to cells of organ systems is result. so its no surprise that chemical drugs that control insulin might improve memory loss. but better than drugs is to maintain proper diet. that boils down to avoiding all processed foods and sugars choosing instead to consume diet primarily of organic fruits and vegetables mostly raw especially dark green leafy vegetables like kale mustard greens collard greens swiss chard watercress spinach and arugula other green vegetables like romaine bok choy cabbage brussels sprouts asparagus broccoli string beans snow peas and green peas non green but nutrient rich vegetables like beets eggplant mushrooms onions radishes bean sprouts red and yellow bell peppers radicchio cauliflower tomatoes artichokes and raw carrots. our diet should be 80 percent vegetables organic with only 20 percent meats preferably free range and not exposed to gmos or antibiotics. we can also augment out diet with supplements that have been shown to help slow advance of alzheimers though clinical trials have not yet confirmed their effectiveness in every case. they include herbs and extracts cats claw bilberry and blackcurrant extracts huperzine vinpocetine cognitive protectant from periwinkle plant. getting lot of attention in scientific circles is curcumin anti inflammatory molecule in turmeric root relative of ginger. turmeric has been used in asian cultures for thousands of years as food flavoring and in medicinal preparations. its common seasoning in indian cuisine which has low incidence of alzheimers. whether turmeric can be credited with protecting indians from alzheimers or if its due to genetics or some other factor is not clearly known. but coincidence is intriguing. mary s. easton of ucla alzheimer translation center stated our group has tested curcumin in several models and found that it not only reduces oxidative damage and inflammation as expected but also reduces amyloid accumulation and synaptic marker loss while promoting both amyloid phagocytosis and clearance. if you d like to learn more about effects of insulin and benefits of balancing your master hormone dr. cutlers book is only one i know of that gives you full story on how medical science missed boat on insulin and provides complete protocol to

prediabetes can be just as deadly as diabetes health before it 's news. ,naturalhealth365 prediabetes elevated blood sugar that has not yet reached threshold for clinical diabetes is widespread in united states. now several recent studies have revealed dangers of being prediabetic including heightened risk of heart disease cancer dementia and stroke. read on to learn more about prediabetes and what you can do to reverse it. prediabetes characterized by fasting glucose level between 100 and 125 mg dl is becoming more common across america. 2016 ucla study revealed that shocking 46 percent of all adults in california either have prediabetes or suffer from undiagnosed type 2 diabetes meaning that almost half of adult population of state has blood sugar that is too high. and elevated blood sugar could very well be even more widespread in other states across nation as california residents usually score near top of scale for longevity and healthy lifestyles. for many term prediabetes seems to imply that no damage has occurred yet. all too often condition is viewed as yellow traffic signal signaling caution and possibly triggering resolution to adopt healthier habits. but in reality diagnosis of prediabetes should function as red light signaling serious health threat. truth is even with fasting glucose levels at medically accepted threshold it is entirely possible that major microvascular damage has already occurred ushering in heart disease kidney failure vision loss neuropathy and cancer. studies have shown that high normal blood sugar raises risk of degenerative diseases as well as increasing risk of dementia by causing shrinkage in hippocampus and amygdala areas of brain involved in memory and cognition. in addition elevated sugar levels shorten telomeres caps on ends of chromosomes that protect them against unraveling and breakage. this is of great importance because longer telomeres are strongly associated with longer life. experts say that shocking 70 percent of prediabetics will go on to develop clinical type 2 diabetes characterized by fasting glucose level of 125 mg dl and above. and by that time significant damage may have occurred making distinction between prediabetes and diabetes somewhat of moot point. for instance 10-year study of 1.800 people showed that prediabetics and diabetics alike had surprisingly similar risk of cardiovascular disease. another study of over 2.000 men with fasting glucose over 85 mg dl showed that they were 40 percent more likely to die from heart disease than those in optimal range. and researchers have found that premenopausal women with fasting blood sugar exceeding 84 mg dl have more than twice risk of developing breast cancer compared with those with lower levels. some natural health experts speaking out against mainstream medicines cavalier attitude towards prediabetes maintain that condition should be classified as diabetes with high normal glucose levels being recognized for health threat that they are. very presence of excess insulin contributes to disease with process starting even before fasting glucose becomes high enough to reach prediabetic levels of 100 to 125 mg dl. although conventional medicine considers fasting glucose of 100 mg dl to be high normal some integrative healthcare providers believe that fasting glucose level over 85 mg dl calls for glucose lowering therapies. likewise hemoglobin a1c reading which measures average blood sugar levels over past two to three months should nt exceed 5.5 percent. research shows that optimal blood sugar lies at low end of normal reference range. high glycemic diet which causes spikes in after meal glucose levels is typically heavy in starches and refined sugars. studies show that consuming this type of diet dramatically increases odds of developing various forms of cancer. after all glucose fuels cancer cells and hormone insulin can stimulate cancer cell proliferation. in just published study of 4.000 participants conducted at university of texas anderson cancer center and published in cancer epidemiological biomarker prevention researchers found that those who consumed high glycemic diet virtually doubled their risk of developing lung cancer whether they smoked or not when compared to those with lowest glycemic diet. since full 25 percent of people who develop lung cancer are non smokers its obvious that other factors are at work here with dietary considerations and blood sugar issues playing important role. natural solutions exist to stop prediabetes in its tracks if you would like to lower your blood sugar levels you may be able to do it with simple lifestyle changes such as cutting back on simple sugars and starches avoiding processed foods and reducing overall caloric intake. eating organic diet high in foods with low glycemic load such as fruits vegetables nuts legumes whole grains and olive oil is associated with lower risk of prediabetes. and losing weight if you are overweight and increasing physical activity can also help send your blood sugar levels in right direction. in light of recent studies takeaway is clear. having blood sugar levels on low side of normal appears to be excellent way to slash risk of breast cancer lung cancer and heart disease and extend quality of your life.,naturalhealth365 prediabetes elevated blood sugar that has

cure for diabetes obesity lewrockwell. ,individuals with metabolic problems elevated blood sugar insulin resistance obesity are caught in middle of major shift in scientific understanding of what induces these problems. modern medicine treats diabesity either by medical model drugs or bariatric surgery gastric band or bypass when it is now recognized that alterations in composition of bacteria in lower intestine gut initiate these problems. patients may have to venture on their own to put corrective measures into practice. inclusion of more indigestible carbohydrates in american diet is most practical remedy but public is likely to get confused over advice to limit processed carbohydrates bread rice pasta cereal vs. increased consumption of bran pectin and other indigestible carbohydrates. it is unlikely american public will go back to eating unprocessed foods. convenience and prepared foods reign. particular bacterium akkermansia muciniphila akk is responsible for production of butyrate major source of cell energy in gut. provision of butyrate completely eradicates measures of metabolic illness in laboratory animals but may only produce transient effect in humans. use of other indigestible fibers bran pectin polyphenols is likely to be most efficacious. indigestible starch is another preferential option. weight reduction can be achieved by these measures via promotion of satiation that results in eating less food and by burning more calories. how does diabetes get started. in 2007 researchers in france were first to report gut bacteria initiates to onset of adult diabetes and inability to utilize insulin.[i insulin is hormone secreted by pancreas that permits glucose sugar to enter living cells that then produces energy that cells need to function. insulin grabs glucose from blood circulation and puts it into cells. glucose produced in liver is bodys main source of fuel. when fat muscle and liver cells begin ignoring insulin blood sugar levels rise. now supplements prebi ... buy new 10.79 gut bacteria produce short chain fatty acids. long chain fatty acids are found in commonly consumed oils obtained from fish nuts avocado olive soybean and other plant oils. three short chain fatty acids predominate in digestive tract large intestine butyrate acetate and propionate and are produced from fermentation of non digestible carbohydrates oligo or polysaccharides aka fiber. this knowledge results in recommendation for more fiber in diet usually obtained from cereals fruits and vegetables. abundance or shortage of these short chain fatty acids determine whether humans are healthy or have metabolic problems insulin resistance elevated blood sugar levels and obesity. diabetics hear they must limit carbohydrate intake bread rice pasta cereal which are refined and processed devoid of bran that can ferment and induce short chain fatty acids in lower digestive tract. so advice about carbohydrates may be confusing for diabetics. carbohydrate reduction accounts for 71 of reduction in blood glucose levels achieved by short term fasting.[ii fast forward to 2018. researchers report loss of one specific type of bacteria in human gut triggers chronic low grade inflammation that signals cells to ignore insulin. akkermansia muciniphila or akk facilitates breakdown of fiber into butyrate and acetate whereas decline in volume of akk triggers living cells to ignore insulin and also results in less butyrate. when animals were given antibiotic to increase proportion of akk bacteria in their digestive tract cells began to respond to insulin again. provision of butyrate had same effect. without akk integrity of intestines is impaired and leakage of bacterial products endotoxins activates white blood cells monocytes to arrive in such large numbers as to induce inflammation with resultant insulin resistance.[iii studies involving akk bacteria have moved from animal lab to human investigation. when obese diabetic adults were compared to lean healthy individuals subjects who exhibited healthiest metabolism blood glucose sugar levels body fat distribution had highest levels of mucin controlling akk bacteria.[iv akkermansia muciniphila is now being heralded as next generation beneficial bacterium that promises to quell diabesity epidemic that has plagued modern populations that consume fiber poor processed foods. while there are broad variety of probiotics being sold namely offering acidophilus and bifidus bacteria development of akk probiotic dietary supplement looms. however probiotics do nt survive and grow like lawn seed. they only produce brief response that transiently heightens immune response. akk bacteria does not always produce beneficial effect casting doubt on its introduction as probiotic. for example excessive akk bacteria in lab animals results in elevated blood pressure problem that was abolished by red wine molecule resveratrol.[v while akk is one of most abundant single species of bacteria in human gut 0.5 to 5.0 of total bacteria that is involved in production and degradation of mucus in lower digestive tract various prebiotics can increase abundance of akk bacteria by 100-fold up to 4.5 in high fat diet compared to 0.09 to 2.5 for normal chow provided to lab animals. so maybe prebiotic that increases proportion of akk rather than akk probiotic would be most efficacious. given that akk bacteria levels are low in obese and diabetic individuals and both antidiabetic drug metformin and bariatric surgery produce marked increase in akk bacteria diabetologists now say revolution in treatment of metabolic disorders is at hand. agents that increase akk bacteria within composition of thousands of species of bacteria in human gut may also quell gout fatty liver and inflammatory bowel problems latter by increasing thickness of mucus barrier in gut and therefore diminishing toxins that plague many sufferers with irritable bowel.[vi while nutritionists are hell bent on creating fat phobia butyrate itself is component of butter 3 4. in fact butter is richest dietary source of butyrate.[vii not all sources of fiber are equal in their ability to produce butyrate. pectin cellulose and bran are good sources of fiber that generate butyrate. however indigestible resistant starch produces almost twice as much cell energy short chain fatty acids mainly butyrate for cells in lower large intestine than butyrate compared to other sources of fiber bran pectin cellulose).[viii with knowledge that butyrate is more than just agent that governs insulin utilization we begin to understand how butyrate exhibits control over human library of genes genome by its inherent ability to loosen or tighten strands of genes around histone bodies that allow our genes to be in read or non read mode. more butyrate more genes that are activated make proteins. this throws whole topic of gut bacteria and butyrate into realm of anti aging pills. butyrate has been demonstrated to prevent brain cell death and extend lifespan of laboratory mice.[ix moreover butyrate has been demonstrated to have profound effect on improving learning and memory which has application in maintenance of mental function with advancing age. diabetes insulin resistance and obesity come with advancing age. therefore link between butyrate and human genome opens doorway to healthy aging and prolonged health span and lifespan. traditionally fermente ... shannon stonger best price 13.23 buy new 14.09 more intriguing is that butyrate has been demonstrated to reduce appetite in lab animals not in gut but in hypothalamus of brain where satiation is controlled. butyrate acts via gut brain connection. oral but not intravenous butyrate produced this remarkable effect which points to need for butyrate to be present in digestive tract not just in blood circulation to exert its biological activity. of interest when researchers severed vagus nerve that connects gut with brain in lab animals given butyrate this completely negated its appetite reduction effect upon hypothalamus in brain.[x in animals fed very high fat diet butyrate reduces leptin levels.[xi leptin is hormone that controls satiation. leptin levels continue to rise if there is leptin resistance. in 2009 researchers first reported that supplemental butyrate prevents insulin resistance in laboratory animals. butyrate also prevented obesity among lab animals fed high fat diet. butyrate accomplished this not by reduced food intake or reduced absorption of dietary fat but by increased burning of calories thermogenesis. it was noted that butyrates beneficial metabolic activity is similar to those produced by red wine molecule resveratrol.[xii manipulation of gut bacteria to treat adult diabetes and obesity was realized in 2014 when researchers linked use of anti diabetic drug metformin with increase in akk bacteria in human gut.[xiii metformin most widely used anti diabetic medication favorably alters composition of gut bacteria via increase of akk bacteria that fosters production of short chain fatty acids like butyrate. this discovery has opened new door to control obesity and diabetes and aging itself.[xiv fatty liver along with liver fibrosis scarring condition that is estimated to effect one third of americans is alleviated by butyrate.[xv there are no proven medicines for fatty liver. of acute interest are unrelenting cases of gout. gout is known as malady of meat eaters. but in modern times gout inexplicably persists in many instances among individuals who do nt consume much meat. scientific studies have only recently revealed intestinal bacteria rather than uric acid levels distinguish gout patients from healthy adults.[xvi butyrate is now considered remedy for gout.[xvii there are other non metabolic health benefits derived from butyrate. for example virulence and growth fate of lyme disease borrelia burgdorferi bacterial infection from contact with ticks is dramatically reduces.[xviii composition of gut bacteria may make difference between life and death should heart attack occur. when heart attack was intentionally induced in laboratory animals sterilization of bacteria from gut with antibiotics prior to heart attack impaired repair mechanisms and survival of animals which improved after supplementation with butyrate and acetate.[xix butyrate and other short chain fatty acids acetate propionate play major role in regulation of inflammation and in normalizing immune response.[xx akk bacteria count is low among patients with psoriasis.[xxi there is probably no going back to fiber rich diets. processed convenience foods predominate in developed populations. so there is search for molecules that can be added as fortification of foods or used as dietary supplements that boost akk bacteria and butyrate. suggested fiber intake is ~16 35 grams day. in western societies about 20 25 grams of fiber is consumed daily though diets high in fruit and vegetables may provide as much as 60 grams of fiber day.[xxii efforts to increase plant food consumption have fallen flat. that leads investigators to question can butyrate normally by product of fiber fermentation in lower large intestine be provided directly as dietary supplement to quell insulin resistance. after years of investigation researchers now say it is becoming clear that gut bacteria play preventive role in pathologies such as diabetes obesity and inflammatory bowel disease.[xxiii trial of oral butyrate supplementation was conducted among healthy and obese adults. four grams 2000 milligrams twice day of butyrate was employed with limited effects. butyrate did however encounter white blood cells monocytes and inhibit inflammation that typically accompanies their arrival. authors of that study say effect of oral butyrate supplementation was most likely only transient.[xxiv researchers says 4000 mg butyrate only produced beneficial effects among younger lean subjects.[xxv resistant starch d ... gregory stevens check amazon for pricing. so maybe volumes of plant foods do nt need to be consumed to produce metabolic boost. while fruits and vegetables have long been recommended for their fiber content molecules called polyphenols also found in fruits and spices may also promote akk bacteria. commonly known polyphenols are found in grapes resveratrol apples and onions quercetin catechin tea turmeric spice curcumin cinnamaldehyde cinnamon pomegranate ellagitannins olives oleuropein and cranberries proanthocyanidins. for example diet fortified with butyrate rich butter and grape powder polyphenols reduced fat cells and fatty liver along with increase in akk bacteria.[xxvi cranberry extract has been found to increase population of akk bacteria in lab animals and exert beneficial effects such as reduced insulin resistance and inflammation.[xxvii resveratrol probably most studied polyphenol has been found to produce marked changes in composition of gut bacteria and improve insulin sensitivity in laboratory mice.[xxviii amino acids promote production of butyrate acetate and propionate but not always in most desirable way.[xxix amino acid leucine is used by body builders to stimulate muscle growth as it is much more powerful than any other amino acid in this regard. however butyrate has been remarkably reported to promote fat burning ketogenesis more than leucine.[xxx of note combination of leucine low dose resveratrol exhibits synergistic action to manage insulin resistance and obesity in lab animals.[xxxi butyrate dietary supplements are available commercially. so are array of polyphenolic nutraceuticals. however research studies show indigestible starch produces most cell energy for cells in lower digestive tract see chart below. resistant indigestible corn starch maltodextrin commercially available under trade name fibersol-2 is fermentable non gmo fiber that has gras status in

so fermentable it may induce intestinal gas and is reported to produce gastrointestinal discomfort.[2 however use of 15 grams of fibersol-2 resistant starch successfully increases beneficial bacteria counts in adults with only minor gastrointestinal discomfort.[3 various doses of fibersol-2 were employed in another human study and produced no diarrhea and only mild and transient discomfort gurgling sounds).[4 so it is consumer friendly. another driver of diabesity are high iron storage ferritin levels. normal healthy ferritin blood levels range from 20 90 nanograms milliliter and are generally elevated in males who do not experience blood loss as do menstruating females.[5 higher ferritin iron storage levels are associated with insulin resistance and obesity particularly in males.[6 higher iron stores ferritin are also found among adults with pre diabetes.[7 it is not surprising to learn that metformin antidiabetic drug reduces ferritin iron storage)[8 as well as increases akk bacteria count and butyrate. neither is it surprising to learn that metformin is being repurposed as anti aging drug.[9 given that bran encourages production of butyrate and within rice bran is strong iron controlling molecule phytic acid or ip6 and ip6 has been demonstrated to exert control over diabetes[10 it may be desirable component of any regimen employed to prevent diabetes and obesity. ip6 and its molecular cousin inositol serve as agents to promote healthy gut bacteria and prevent fatty liver.[11 apple pectin another butyrate booster that has been shown to promote beneficial gut bacteria and reduce inflammation is on list of natural remedies for diabesity.[12 gut bacteria model of health has been slow to be adopted into practice of medicine largely due to initial complexity posed by vast array of bacterial species involved. alteration of gut bacteria to prevent diabetes and obesity runs head on into pharmacologic anti diabetic drugs that are fraught

cents. warning is bold and comes from united nations top health organisation which is urging people to get up and get active. and risks of inactivity are expanding alarmingly according to new document by world health organization who less and less people are active in many countries with nearly quarter of all adults and more than 80 per cent of adolescents being too sedentary. who s global action plan for prevention and control of ncds non communicable diseases 2013 2020 recommends that inactive people start with small amounts of physical activity and then gradually increase duration frequency and intensity over time. physical activity can be any activity not just sport that uses energy from playing and doing household chores to gardening and dancing any activity be it for work to walk or cycle to and from places or as part of leisure time has health benefit according to geneva based un agency. not really sure. see these 10 facts that united nations top health agency has prepared fact 1 physical activity reduces risk of disease physical activity reduces risk of coronary heart disease and stroke diabetes hypertension various types of cancer including colon cancer and breast cancer as well as depression. physical activity is also fundamental to energy balance and weight control. globally about 23 per cent of adults and 81 per cent of school going adolescents are not active enough. generally women and girls are less active than men and boys and older adults are less active than younger adults. improve their muscular and cardio respiratory fitness improve their bone and functional health have lower rates of coronary heart disease high blood pressure stroke diabetes cancer including colon and breast cancer and depression have lower risk of falling and of hip or vertebral fractures and are more likely to maintain their weight. fact 3 it is not same as sport physical activity is any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that uses energy. this includes sports exercise and other activities such as playing walking household chores gardening and dancing. any activity be it for work to walk or cycle to and from places or as part of leisure time has health benefit. fact 4 moderate vigorous physical activity bring benefits intensity refers to rate at which activity is being performed. it can be thought of as how hard person works to do activity. intensity of different forms of physical activity varies between people. depending on individuals relative level of fitness examples of moderate physical activity could include brisk walking dancing or household chores. examples of vigorous physical activity could be running fast cycling fast swimming or moving heavy loads. people aged 517 should have at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily. more than 60 minutes of physical activity day brings additional health benefits. adults aged 1864 should do at least 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activity each week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity throughout week or equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity. in order to be beneficial for cardio respiratory health all activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration. fact 7 adults aged 65 and above main recommendations for adults and older adults are same. in addition older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls 3 or more days per week. when older adults can not do recommended amount of physical activity due to health conditions they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow. fact 8 all healthy adults need to be physically active unless specific medical conditions indicate contrary who s recommendations apply to all people irrespective of gender race ethnicity or income level. these recommendations also apply to individuals with chronic non communicable conditions not related to mobility such as hypertension or diabetes. adults with disabilities should also follow who s recommendations. fact 9 some physical activity is better than none inactive people should start with small amounts of physical activity and gradually increase duration frequency and intensity over time. inactive adults older adults and those with disease limitations will have added health benefits when they become more active. pregnant women postpartum women and persons with cardiac conditions may need to take extra precautions and seek medical advice before striving to achieve recommended levels of physical activity. fact 10 supportive environments communities help people be physically active urban and environmental policies have huge potential to increase levels of physical activity. these policies should ensure that walking cycling and other forms of active transportation are accessible and safe for all labour and workplace policies encourage physical activity schools have safe spaces and facilities for students to spend their free time actively and sports and recreation facilities provide opportunities for everyone to be physically active. still there. get up. move now. author baher kamals article was

",natural news as its name implies steroid diabetes is form of diabetes that stemmed from use of certain steroid drugs. german study recently found how steroid based drug treatment could eventually lead to appearance of metabolic disorder. researchers at institute for diabetes and obesity ido examined type of steroid called glucocorticoids. these steroids are often used as part of pharmaceutical drugs for managing symptoms caused by excessive or unnecessary inflammation of cells and tissues. glucocorticoids such as cortisone have been used to treat inflammatory diseases such as asthma or rheumatism for many decades and they are most commonly prescribed anti inflammatory drugs explained ido researcher henriette uhlenhaut. they are also frequently used in autoimmune diseases organ transplantations and cancer. experts believe that anywhere from one to three percent of population of western countries are taking glucocorticoids as treatments for various diseases. in germany alone there are more than one million people who have been prescribed these steroids. related did you know that turmeric is just as effective as 14 pharmaceutical drugs. steroid based treatments can ruin metabolism of patients glucocorticoids are recommended by healthcare providers for all kinds of medical conditions. but they have also been shown to cause numerous side effects including altering metabolism of patient during treatment period. these steroids worked by binding to their target receptor within cell. once bound receptor would activate and deactivate various genes. many of these genes were involved in metabolic processes. when metabolic genes went awry they could disrupt normal balance of metabolic system. if taken for too long or in large amounts glucocorticoids could bring about onset of diabetes serious metabolic disorder. with this concern in mind ido researchers launched study to identify specific sequence of events that took place during moment that steroids bound themselves to their receptor. they worked alongside their counterparts from max delbrck center for molecular medicine salk institute for biological studies and university of freiburg. by disrupting metabolic genes glucocorticoids can cause steroid diabetes what struck us most was e47 transcription factor which along with glucocorticoid receptor is responsible for changes in gene expression particularly in liver cells said ido researcher charlotte hemmer who served as first author of new study. we were able to identify underlying pathway by conducting genome wide analyses and genetic studies. transcription factor is molecule that controls activity or expression of gene. in this case e47 transcription factor controlled e47 gene which is responsible for certain metabolic processes. ido led research team sought to expand on initial findings of their experiment. they created model using mice that did not have e47 gene and treated animals with glucocorticoids. their follow up testing showed that lack of e47 gene kept metabolism of mice safe from glucocorticoids. in comparison normal mice that retained their e47 gene experienced alterations to their metabolism. their blood sugar levels and blood fat levels went up and harmful fatty acids accumulated in their livers. these issues happened to be symptoms of diabetes. e47 gene is also found in humans. researchers are planning to see if their discovery in mice could be applied to people as well. in meantime it might be wise to stop using glucocorticoids as anti inflammatory medicine. instead look for alternative ways to reduce inflammation that do not affect metabolic genes. diabetes is very serious disease and very steep potential price to pay for relief from inflammatory conditions.,

prevent even reverse diabetes type 1 and 2 alternative before it 's news.,turmeric extract may prevent even reverse diabetes type 1 and 2 what if long sought after cure for diabetes was as safe affordable and accessible as spice sitting in your kitchen cupboard. slowly but surely world is waking up to reality that diabetes is not only preventable but reversible condition and that drug based model of symptom suppression and disease management has fatal flaws. for instance some of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes actually increase risk of death with recent study showing gmo insulin given to type 2 diabetics may lead to development of so called double diabetes type 2 and type 1 diabetes together. clearly if medicine ca nt at least abide by its founding principle to do no harm it must seek answer somewhere other than from chemists pot. as pharmaceutically driven medical paradigm continues to lose adherents by droves and public seeks system that identifies and resolves root causes of disease interest is growing in use of natural substances and lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat blood sugar disorders. and unlike few decades ago where most of evidence for natural healing was anecdotal there are now thousands of studies on hundreds of natural substances and therapeutic activities that may ameliorate blood sugar disorders and their complications. you can check out good portion of relevant research on topic on greenmedinfo.coms blood sugar disorder database. while plants like cinnamon and gymnema sylvestre have received plenty of attention for diabetes over years one special plant extract that is beginning to stand out from crowd as being exceptionally valuable as anti diabetic agent is turmeric. there are in fact 21 articles on turmerics value in type 2 diabetes on our database alone. turmerics primary polyphenol curcumin is main compound in plant that has been researched for its blood sugar regulating properties. one particularly striking study published in american diabetic associations own journal diabetes care found turmeric extract to be 100 effective in preventing pre diabetics from developing type 2 diabetes feat of prevention that no fda approved drug for type 2 diabetes has yet come even close to accomplishing. it turns out that this spice may be powerful therapeutic intervention for more than just type 2 diabetics. pre clinical research now reveals it may have role in reversing pancreatic damage in insulin dependent type 1 diabetics who are routinely told that their condition can not be cured. type 1 diabetics are rarely educated to fact that root cause of their disorder can be addressed namely that deficiency and/or dysfunction of beta cells in pancreas responsible for producing insulin can be repaired as well as autoimmune issues at heart of problem. back in 2013 exciting study published in journal diabetology metabolic syndrome titled effect of novel curcumin derivative on pancreatic islet regeneration in experimental type-1 diabetes in rats long term study found that diabetic rats who received novel water soluble high concentrate 53.21 curcumin derivative orally for 40 days showed improvement of their plasma glucose insulin and c peptide marker for health and insulin producing capability of beta cells levels that began after about 4 months and continued to improve until 10 month mark when their values were almost completely normalized and evidence of significant pancreatic regeneration could be observed. researchers concluded novel curcumin derivative ncd possesses antidiabetic actions and enhanced pancreatic islets regeneration. daily dose used in this rodent study 80 mg kg was body weight equivalent of 6.400 mg or 6.4 grams of curcumin for average north american male adult 80 kilograms/176 lbs. rodent and human physiology is of course radically different but significant crossovers nonetheless do exist. in another article titled why turmeric may be diseased livers best friend we reviewed research indicating that turmeric may help to reverse damage in and even regenerate diabetic liver as well as safety literature on what is safe human dose given that organ transplantation pancreatic islet transplants is exceedingly expensive and prohibitive due to lack of donor material and potential for rejection by host notion that safe affordable and non prescription spice extract like curcumin may have significant therapeutic value and may even regenerate damaged pancreatic tissue is truly exciting. that said it should be noted that since curcumin is not patentable it is unlikely 800 million dollars or more needed to fund requisite clinical trials needed to obtain fda drug approval will materialize. because so called evidence needed to justify use of new treatment is locked behind insurmountably high paywall do nt count on randomized controlled trials being performed on this natural cure in near or distant future. in this study authors surmised that ameliorative effects curcumin treatment on type 1 diabetic rodents observed were result of beta cell regeneration and they explained theory behind how this works researchers theorized that curcumin likely produces curcumins immunomodulatory benefit in type 1 diabetes also known as autoimmune diabetes appears to be based on it reducing activity of host immune system in attacking self structures. in fact another recent study published in 2014 in journal clinical and experimental immunology titled curcumin ameliorates autoimmune diabetes. evidence in accelerated murine models of type 1 diabetes found that curcumin down regulates t cell response that destroys pancreatic beta cells resulting in improvement in autoimmune or type 1 diabetes. it is important for reader to know that curcumin is not magic bullet nor is it only natural substance studied to have potential beta cell regenerative properties. indeed pancreatic regeneration has been induced experimentally for at least 23 different natural substances. we have keyword dedicated to indexing relevant research on topic here beta cell regeneration. we ve highlighted 10 of most compelling ones in our article 10 natuaral substances that could help reverse diabetes. as research continues to accumulate on value of natural substances for disease prevention and treatment it is clear future of medicine will rely

epidemic instances of those developing type 2 diabetes are increasing at alarming rate. we know that poor diet that is high in sugar and animal protein combined with inactivity are two common factors of typical western diet and way of life that can lead to type 2 diabetes. what is not very well known and not often discussed is that there are many are dealing with this disease for lesser known reasons that are sometimes completely out of their control. recommended free ithrive docu series. learn how to reverse diabetes and obesity. in this day and age we are exposed to thousands of chemicals in our environment usually every day. chemicals are found in everything from food we eat air we breathe clothes we wear water we drink and quite frankly virtually every aspect of our lives and lot of them are bad. effects of all these chemicals bad ones is almost like elephant in room its not often that fingers are pointed to these chemicals and potential harm they are doing to our bodies. certain chemicals like bpa found in plastic and canned goods vehicle exhaust and phthalates these common environmental chemicals can alter our health in several different ways. cost analysis published in lancet in 2016 stated that diseases related to everyday household chemicals cost united states 340 billion annually let that sink in for moment. increasing amount of research has been pointing towards many other environmental contaminants and chemicals that can drastically increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. in fact there are much more important factors to be aware of its not only diet and physical activity like we have been led to believe. 1. arsenic research has shown that chronic exposure to arsenic can interfere with insulin secretion which can increase risk of developing type 2 diabetes. study published in american journal of physiology in 2017 stated that arsenic contaminates drinking water of approximately 100 million people globally and has been associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. 2. bpa also known as bisphenol is synthetic compound that is often used to produce certain types of plastics in toys canned foods drink liners even medical devices. research has shown that bpa is associated with many health disorders. journal of environmental research and public health human and lab studies suggest that bpa exposure is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. this chemical acts directly on pancreatic cells and impairs insulin and glucagon secretion which can trigger insulin resistant state. best ways to avoid bpa. limit your exposure to plastic of all kinds choose glass or stainless steel whenever possible and say no to receipts from cash register which are usually coated with bpa or similar chemical compounds. 3. pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls are chemicals that are used in hundreds of industrial and commercial applications. they were officially banned in u.s. in 1979 however these chemicals tend to linger. research shows that pcbs will remain in human body for long time after exposure because toxins accumulate in our fatty tissues. bob weinhold member of society of environmental journalists examined studies conducted on mice that showed how exposure to pcb was associated with significant impairment of glucose and insulin tolerance. researchers also found that exposure to pcb increased concentrations of cytokines which are also related to insulin resistance. there are ways to reduce your exposure to pcb chemicals you can read more about that here. 4. pahs or polyacrylic aromatic hydrocarbons are naturally occurring chemicals that can be found in gasoline crude oil and coal. they are produced when coal gas oil tobacco and garbage are burned and contaminate air we breathe with vehicle exhaust cigarette smoke burnt wood and burnt meat. study published in 2014 in occupational and environmental medicine indicated that high urinary levels of pahs in participants who were monitored over 5 year period are associated with development of type 2 diabetes in u.s. adults between ages of 20 to 65 years. researchers pointed to previous studies that have also reported that chronic exposure to pahs is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation also playing major role in development of type 2 diabetes. smoking cigarettes and consuming pahs in food are primary sources of pahs in u.s. to limit your exposure do not smoke and do not cook meat or other foods at extremely high temperatures. limit your intake of grilled and charred foods. 5. phthalates are chemicals that again are used in plastics in order to increase durability flexibility and transparency of many plastic products. study conducted in australia detected phthalates in 99.6 percent of participant urine samples and were able to find that phthalate concentrations were positively associated with type 2 diabetes as well as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. researchers adjusted for other factors that normally contribute to these health factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking but link between phthalates and disease stayed same. 6. mercury we all know that mercury is dangerous substance and should be avoided at all costs but research has also shown that specifically mercury can induce hyperglycemia by altering function of pancreatic beta cells. systematic review published in environmental research looked at 34 studies that measured increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome due to exposure to mercury. 7. cadmium is found naturally in environment and is released through smelting and mining. its used in many industrial processes such as metal plating stabilizing plastics and producing pigments. it can contaminate food that comes from soil or water that contains cadmium. in 2017 meta analysis evaluated 9 different studies with combined total of 28.691 participants in order to determine if there was association between cadmium exposure and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. researchers found that for every 1 microgram per gram of urinary cadmium risk of diabetes increased by whopping 16 percent. exposure to cadmium through diet alone is nt believed to be cause for concern but smokers and those exposed to high levels of cadmium through their occupations are at greater risk. full list of occupations that increase risk of toxic cadmium exposure is provided by agency for toxic substances and disease registry. 8. pesticides these are chemicals that are used abundantly in agriculture to prevent and destroy pests and insects that might interfere with growth and productivity of crops. systematic review and meta analysis published in environment international reviewed role of pesticides in pathogenesis of diabetes. included were 22 studies and positive association between increased pesticide exposure and prevalence of diabetes. adverse effects of pesticides can be chronic or acute depending on your level of exposure. to reduce your exposure go organic whenever possible but especially when purchasing any foods from dirty dozen list these are foods that contain highest levels of pesticides. 9. nickel nickel is metal that is used to make coins jewelry batteries and heat exchangers. this metal is released into our environment from stacks and large furnaces at power plants or trash incinerators. it is also released in industrial waste water and ends up in soil. study published in journal of epidemiology looked at association of nickel exposure with prevalence of type 2 diabetes among adults in china. what was found was that median concentration of urinary nickel among 2.115 participants observed was 3.6 milligrams per liter and prevalence of diabetes was 35 percent. these elevated levels of urinary nickel were positively associated with higher fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance. watch free 9 part docu series called ithrive to learn more about reversing diabetes and obesity.,diabetes has

fasting can completely reverse type 2 diabetes.,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed your sickness. hippocrates fasting has not received as much attention as it should when it comes to world of health and medicine. that s because you ca nt really make any money off of it. pharmaceutical science studies used in medical schools to teach doctors about human health simply do nt focus enough on fasting for doctors to be knowledgable in subject. doctors also learn very little about nutrition and are trained to prescribe drugs as result. dr. jason fung is trying to change all that. toronto based nephrologist he completed medical school and internal medicine at university of toronto before finishing his nephrology fellowship at university of california los angeles at cedars sinai hospital. he joined scarborough general hospital in 2001 where he continues to practice and change peoples lives. he is one of growing number of scientists and doctors to create awareness about tremendous health benefits that can be achieved from fasting. its one of oldest dietary interventions in world and has been practiced for thousands of years. if properly practiced fasting was bad or harmful in any way as some doctors suggest it would have been known by now and studies would not be emerging showing health benefits that can be achieved from fasting regularly. for example recent study published in journal cell shows how fasting diet can trigger pancreas to regenerate itself which works to control blood sugar levels and reverse symptoms of diabetes. mark mattson one of foremost researchers of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying multiple neurodegenerative disorders like parkinsons and alzheimers disease has shown through his work that fasting can have tremendous effect on brain and could prevent or even reverse symptoms of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. you can watch great tedx talk he gave on topic here. other studies have shown how fasting actually fights cancer and triggers stem cell regeneration. you can read more about that and access those studies in article we published last year here. there is absolutely no evidence for average person that fasting can be dangerous. if you re on prescription medication or experience other medical problems then there are obviously exceptions. but its quite clear that human body was designed to go long periods of time without food and that its completely natural. why is it that normal diet is three meals day plus snacks. it is nt that its healthiest eating pattern now that s my opinion but i think there is lot of evidence to support that. there are lot of pressures to have that eating pattern there s lot of money involved. food industry are they going to make money from skipping breakfast like i did today. no they re going to lose money. if people fast food industry loses money. what about pharmaceutical industries. what if people do some intermittent fasting exercise periodically and are very healthy is pharmaceutical industry going to make any money on healthy people. dr. mark mattson taken from his tedx talk linked above dr. fung recently published book co authored with jimmy moore titled complete guide to fasting heal your body through intermittent alternate day and extended fasting its great book that puts to rest fears and myths associated with extended water fasting. he also recently published obesity code unlocking secrets of weight loss fung like 90 percent of doctors out there was conventionally oriented. he is kidney specialist and many of his patients had have type 2 diabetes as result of that. it eventually became clear to him that something was very wrong with conventional treatment of type 2 diabetes. with type 2 diabetes patients who take insulin and follow recommended dietary guidelines would still have several complications mainly kidney disease. because of this they can go blind require dialysis or even require amputations. in interview below with dr. joseph mercola dr. fung addresses multiple myths and issues that are commonly brought up about fasting. and dives into explaining how fasting does not burn muscle how it can reverse diabetes addresses starvation mode myth explains role of insulin discusses different variations of fasting and much more. be sure to visit his website where you can find information on him his practice results lectures and article that he continually publishes every month. humans live on one quarter of what they eat on other three quarters lives their doctor. egyptian pyramid inscription one recommended way of doing it which was tested by bbcs michael mosley in order to reverse his diabetes high cholesterol and other problems associated with his obesity is what is known as 5:2 diet. on 5:2 plan you cut your food down to one fourth of your normal daily calories on fasting days about 600 calories for men and about 500 for women while consuming plenty of water and tea. on other five days of week you can eat normally. another way to do it as mentioned above is to restrict your food intake between hours of 12 pm and 7 pm daily while not eating during hours outside of that time. its good to see more and more people becoming more conscious about our planet and what is happening on it its great to see more people take active role in doing some independent research and critical thinking. disease rates are skyrocketing and have been for quite some time. large portion of this can be attributed to our eating habits and all of toxic and harmful substances we put into our bodies regularly. over past few years food industry has been exposed in several ways whether its issues concerning gmos and pesticides that go with them or all of examples of pharmaceutical fraud. all of it is result of massive shift in consciousness that s happening on our planet where so much is coming to light in all aspects of our every day lives food and health is just one. fasting is also sparking interest of many because along with this consciousness shift comes awareness of world beyond our physical one. this realm deals with near death experiences quantum physics parapsychology and our overall spiritual nature and proof that s emerging that we are more than just this body and that human beings do indeed have spiritual nature. fact that modern day science in many instances is catching up to ancient wisdom is quite exciting. not only in neuroscience and quantum physics but health as well.,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed.

increased risk of type 2 diabetes health before it 's news.,naturalhealth365 while oral health is important if you are already at higher risk for type 2 diabetes due to genetics or lifestyle decisions then using mouthwash could be increasing it significantly. recent study out of harvard university has found that persons who use mouthwash twice per day are up to 55 percent more likely to develop full blown type 2 diabetes within 3 years. harvard university scientists were looking to analyze links between standard over counter mouthwash and its link to metabolic disorders due to antibacterial ingredients it contains. what they discovered is incredible. using mouthwash twice per day raises type 2 diabetes risk by 30 percent for study 1.206 overweight persons between ages of 40 and 65 were examined. all members of this group had been determined to be at high risk for type 2 diabetes. of those studied 17 percent developed either type 2 diabetes or prediabetes symptoms. this number rose to 20 percent in persons who rinsed with mouthwash once per day. while this was just 3 percent increase what really got researchers attention was results for those participants who used mouthwash twice or more per day. these individuals had 30 percent higher chance of developing either type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. why would this be. researchers speculated it is due to fact that antibacterial agents in mouthwash are not selective. instead of just targeting harmful bacteria in mouth these products target broad range of bacteria including beneficial strains. when positive bacteria are killed in mouth through use of mouthwash body is inhibited in its ability to prevent and protect against type 2 diabetes. people who overuse mouthwash are also more prone to obesity due to killing off assistive microbes that assist body in producing nitric oxide which helps to regulate insulin levels in bloodstream. mouthwash seems like harmless enough product that can bring benefits to oral health. so for many people its hard to believe that using mouthwash could actually be harmful to any aspect of our health. but recent revelations related to destruction of good bacteria and negative effects of overusing antibiotics substantiate this kind of information. consider healthier alternatives to mouthwash to support oral health discover best ways to maintain healthy teeth and gums register now for holistic oral health summit hosted by jonathan landsman mechanisms of type 2 diabetes also share common pathways with blood pressure issues. while these results do not mean that mouthwash causes diabetes they seem to be compelling evidence that its overuse could impair bodys protective mechanisms. add to this fact that most conventional mouthwashes are loaded with toxic ingredients including artificial colors sweeteners and fluoride anyone who currently uses mouthwash should be looking for healthier alternatives. for example there are few good quality herbal rinses like natures answer periobrite or you can try brushing with some essential oils like neem clover or peppermint oil. you ll be left with fresh clean and happy mouth without toxic ingredients. gmos

diabetes risk factors health before it 's news. ,of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. children who are allowed more than three hours of screen time day are at greater risk of developing diabetes guardian reports. in new study uk researchers found link between three hours or more of screen time and risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as higher body fat. study used data from almost 4.500 children aged around 10 years collected between 2004 and 2007. they found that children with more than three hours of screen time per day had higher body fat and insulin resistance compared to children with hour or less per day. screen time was defined as time spent watching television and using computers or games consoles. it is unlikely that screen time itself is causing increase in risk more that this could indicate more sedentary lifestyle. one concern is that data was collected before use of smartphones and tablets became widespread in children. so it could be case that screen time use has now increased among children but we would need further research to confirm this. recent us guidelines are currently no uk guidelines recommend no screen time for infants under 18 months one hour for children aged 2 5 and then older children should be assessed on case by case basis by their parents. study supports current physical activity recommendations for children which say they should do at least hours exercise every day. sticking to this will help reduce risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes in later life. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from university of london and university of glasgow. funding was provided by national institute for health research collaboration for leadership in applied health research and care clahrc. data collection was funded by grants from wellcome trust british heart foundation and national prevention research initiative. study was published in peer reviewed medical journal archives of disease in childhood. there were no conflicts of interest reported by research team. uk media generally reported on this study accurately though none of media outlets really explains why this link may have been seen or that study ca nt prove that screen time itself increases risk. mail online provided number of figures from other sources to add context to study findings. we are unable to comment on accuracy of these sources. what kind of research was this. this is cross sectional survey looking into association between daily screen time and risk markers for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in children aged nine and 10 years. type 2 diabetes and obesity are increasing in adults and children. effect of sedentary behaviour such as watching television and using computers known as screen time are cause for concern and associations have been seen between prolonged screen time and body fatness in children. using data from this survey researchers were able to identify potential risk factors however due to nature of this study design they would not be able to prove that one thing causes other. researchers say they can use their findings to design further studies to prove causation. randomised controlled trial would be required to prove such link. however trial that randomises children to different amounts of sedentary time or physical activity and then follows them for sufficient time to observe outcomes may be neither feasible nor ethical. what did research involve. this was cross sectional study known as child heart and health study in england. researchers carried out survey of primary school children aged nine and 10 years from london birmingham and leicester. single research team collected key information between october 2004 and february 2007. some of information recorded was as follows ethnic origin based on ethnicity of both parents insulin resistance measurement of how bodys cells respond to insulin pubertal status measured in girls girls tend to start puberty earlier than boys on same day as physical measurements were taken children completed questionnaire asking how many hours each day do you spend watching television or video and playing computer games. children had to tick most appropriate response options were hour or less one to two hours two to three hours more than three hours in sub group of children activity was measured using monitor worn around waist. when analysing findings researchers attempted to account for effects of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status physical activity and pubertal status. what were basic results. analysis focused on 4.495 children 2.337 girls and 2.158 boys who had screen time data all physical measurements and fasting blood sample. more than 2.000 children had physical activity data collected from waist monitor. most commonly reported screen time duration was one hour or less 37 with 18 reporting more than three hours and 4 reporting no screen time at all. boys were more likely to have more than three hours of screen time day 22 compared to 14 of girls. differences were seen between ethnic groups higher proportion of black african caribbean children 23 had more than three hours of daily screen time compared with white europeans 16 and south asians 16. children reporting more than three hours of screen time were found to have higher level of body fat than those with hour or less screen time. this was as measured by ponderal index ponderal means related to weight index is measure of kg m3 which was on average 1.9 higher skinfold thickness 4.5 greater fat mass index 3.3 higher and leptin hormone that controls hunger 9.2 higher. they also had higher levels of blood insulin and insulin resistance compared to children taking one hour or less though there was little link with blood glucose control. how did researchers interpret results. researchers conclude strong graded associations between screen time adiposity and insulin resistance suggest that reducing screen time could facilitate early t2d type 2 diabetes prevention. while these observations are of considerable public health interest evidence from randomised controlled trials is needed to suggest causality. this cross sectional study aimed to investigate association between markers for type 2 diabetes and amount of screen time child has. study found association between higher levels of screen time and higher body fat and insulin resistance. however as mentioned this type of study is not able to prove cause and effect. it is most likely not screen time itself that is cause of these factors more that this could indicate generally less healthy and more sedentary lifestyle. similar link might be found for children who spend more time reading books instead of taking physical activity. researchers have tried to adjust for physical activity and socioeconomic status that could be influencing link. however it is possible that some confounding remains in model or that other important factors were missed diet being notable possibility. its also possible that children who reported more screen time may have had other health conditions which were not accounted for in analysis that could have increased their risk. other important limitations are that amount of screen time was self reported and children may not have remembered or reported this accurately. measures of body fat and blood glucose control were also one off measurements taken at single point in time. they do nt tell us that child will go on to develop type 2 diabetes. nevertheless study suggests reduction in screen time could be beneficial in improving health and possibly reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and other obesity related diseases in later life. one pressing concern is that data gathered in study was taken before use of smartphones and tablets became widespread in older children. smartphones became commonly used around 2008 to 2010 and first tablet ipad was released in 2010. so it could well be case that screen time has now increased in older children. with these concerns in mind it is important that children are taught to compensate for time spent gawping at gadgets as mail puts it with time spent being physically active. guidelines for children and young people recommend that to maintain basic level of health at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day should be taken this could be cycling playground activities or more vigorous activity such as running and tennis. exercises for strong muscles and bones are recommended three days week such as push ups jumping and running. read more advice about encouraging children to be more physically active. screentime linked to greater diabetes risk among children. guardian march 13 2017 watching tv three

could help cure type 1 diabetes alternative before it 's news.,could long sought after cure for type 1 diabetes be as close as your kitchen cupboard. accumulating body of scientific research appears to point in exactly that direction. one so called incurable disease that afflicts millions of people around world is type 1 diabetes. unlike type 2 diabetes where body becomes resistant to its own insulin type 1 is characterized by inability of body to produce enough insulin as beta cells within pancreas which are responsible for production of insulin and proinsulin from which it is made are either destroyed or seriously impaired. this can happen due to autoimmune issues bacterial or viral infections incompatible foods in diet and chemical exposures or combination of any one or more of these factors to name but few major triggers. and yet plenty of peer reviewed and published research now indicates that plant compounds including many found within commonly consumed foods are capable of stimulating beta cell regeneration within pancreas and as result may be potentially provide cure truly four letter word as far as profit based model of medicine goes which thrives on concept of incurability of disease afflicted human body in favor of symptom management. discovery of of various food and compounds is bound to upset burgeoning diabetes industry with millions of dollars of public and private money continually being poured into fund raising efforts for future cure cure that will presumably be delivered through prohibitively expensive pharmaceutical vaccine or biologic e.g. stem cells islet cell xenotransplantation pipeline which by very nature of fda drug approval process requires promotion of synthetic and therefore patentable compounds over natural ones. lets take look at latest preclinical study on topic published last month in canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology[1. active fraction of flaxseed which researchers named linun usitassimum active fraction lu6 was found to generate wide range of benefits in type 1 diabetes animal model including following supported normalized glycogenesis glucose forming activity in liver and muscle tissue reduced pancreatic and intestinal glucosidase inhibitory activity which translates into lower post meal blood sugar elevations even more remarkable was observation that this flaxseed compound normalized plasma insulin and c peptide levels c peptide is not c reactive protein rather it is direct indicator of how much insulin is being produced by beta cells in body. learn more indication that researchers described truly amazing results as follows normalization of plasma insulin and c peptide levels were observed in diabetic mice indicating endogenous insulin secretion after treatment with lu6. histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis on pancreatic islets suggests role of lu6 fraction in islet regeneration and insulin secretion as evident in increase functional pancreatic islets producing insulin. furthermore significant insulin producing islet formation was also observed in in vitro panc-1 cells after lu6 treatment indicating cellular aggregates to be newly formed islets. this suggests potential of lu6 fraction in formation of new islets in vitro as well as in vivo. thus lu6 can be used as nutraceutical based first line treatment for diabetes. emphasis added keep in mind that this is not first time that flaxseed has been found to improve blood sugar disorders. we have few studies on greenmedinfo.com already indexed on topic that you can view here flaxseed and diabetes. furthermore we have found broad range of natural substances experimentally confirmed to stimulate beta cell regeneration 10 of which are listed below arginine 2007 study found that amino acid l arginine is capable of stimulating genesis of beta cells in animal model of alloxan induced diabetes.[2 avocado 2007 study found that avocado seed extract reduced blood sugar in diabetic rats. researchers observed restorative and protective effect on pancreatic islet cells in treated group.[3 berberine 2009 study found that this plant compound commonly found in herbs such as barberry and goldenseal induces beta cell regeneration in diabetic rats which lends explanation for why it has been used for 1400 years in china to treat diabetes.[4 chard 2000 study found that chard extract given to diabetic rats stimulates recovery of injured beta cells.[5 corn silk 2009 study found that corn silk reduces blood sugar and stimulates beta cell regeneration in type 1 diabetic rats.[6 curcumin

alzheimer 's disease health before it 's news. ,new link found between diabetes and alzheimer 's disease it is most likely you have heard of dementia and diabetes lot over past years as they have affected lives of millions of people around world. it is also likely you have heard of diabetes being caused of lifestyle choices and how you need to follow healthier life to keep it under control and although that can be true for many cases it is not only truth out there. keep reading to find out more on latest news that science has to offer. first lets talk about diabetes and alzheimers disease diabetes refers to group of diseases in which person suffers from having high level of sugar in blood. sometimes because metabolism does nt produce enough insulin which is hormone responsible for putting that sugar to use and not pile on blood and sometimes just because cells of body do nt respond to insulin. lastly there are types of diabetes where both reasons combine. it is one of most spread diseases worldwide more than 382 million people are affected as it was estimated in 2013. alzheimers disease on other hand is mental disorder which mainly occurs on middle or old aged people and progresses with time. it affects persons memory intellect and abilities like learning reasoning communicating etc. according to latest statistics about 44 million people suffer from this disease throughout world and trend seems to show great increase over last couple of years. you re probably wondering how do these two relate. well doctors have said that link is possible considering how high level of sugar on blood damages blood vessels and when located in brain damaged vessels can trigger alzheimer also it can cause inflammation which again can harm brain cells. further imbalance of hormones caused by insulin is not healthy for brain which needs many other hormones to function normally. considering these ideas scientists started conducting experiments and researches to find proof. several studies came to conclusion that people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes also had symptoms of brain disorders. their brain showed tendency toward insulin resistance and problems with ability to use glucose as needed. moreover it was shocking to find out that people who had been living with diabetes for less than 10 years had smaller hippocampus region in brain than other people role of whom is connected to memory functions. another experiment discovered that participants had quite rapid increase in protein considered toxic for brain cells beta amyloid. besides this their relation continues further when it comes to improve memory. drug used to moderate diabetes metformin was given to one out of two groups of people. group who did use drug had lower risk of developing dementia. new developments as we explained earlier most common theory revolves around idea that diabetes could have some impact on our body which might trigger dementia. however latest research is suggesting otherwise. it is first time that scientists are claiming that alzheimers disease could be leading to diabetes. two research teams one representing alzheimer and one diabetes collaborated to carry on research and investigate further on tie between two diseases. they were mainly pushed by fact that about 80 of people who suffer from alzheimers disease are diagnosed with some type of diabetes as well. surprising huh. this is major discovery which certainly calls for action to find out more. their results were that complications in brain which come from alzheimer could be causing change in way that brain uses glucose change for worse obviously. this also shatters usual belief that diabetes starts with pancreas problems or with terrible diets full of sugar and fat. additionally they report that these two diseases are so close that drugs used for keeping stable glucose levels on blood could also help ease alzheimers features. scientists plan to keep investigating further into alzheimers medications and see if they can have positive effects on diabetes as well. conclusions diabetes and alzheimers disease have connection between however contrary to what has been believed up to now studies are showing that it could be alzheimer leading to diabetes. this happens as consequence of way in which dementia affects normal functioning of brain and creates problems when it comes to using sugar for energy needed by cells. this is one of first researches of its kind and will hopefully be backed by others in near future which will clear things up even more. one thing to look out for is results on possible treatments that could help cure both diseases in same time. now that would be great.,it is most likely you have heard of dementia and diabetes lot over past years as they have affected lives of millions of people around world. it is also likely you have heard of diabetes being caused of lifestyle choices and how you need to follow.

type-2 diabetes.,natural news getting more fiber into your diet is nt just good for digestion. according to study it could also reduce symptoms of diabetes and help with weight loss. study published in journal science revealed that dietary fiber could rebalance gut microbiota encouraging development of specific types of gut bacteria that improve blood glucose regulation. in study lead author liping zhao of school of environmental and biological sciences at rutgers universitynew brunswick and his team investigated relationship between bacteria in gut and diabetes. gut microbiota which is home to billions of bacteria contains both beneficial and harmful microbes. still they all work to not only to ensure proper digestion but also to support immune system and other things as recent studies have begun to highlight. while earlier studies have shown that increase in fiber intake lowers chances of getting type-2 diabetes individual responses have been variable at best. in other cases fiber rich diet helped reduce fasting glucose levels of those who already had diabetes. related fiber and diabetes what you need to know. study could nt have come at better time. in 2017 national diabetes statistics report from centers for disease control and prevention cdc over 30 million people 9.4 percent of u.s. population have diabetes. while data does nt differentiate between types of diabetes cdc says that up to 95 percent of all reported cases are characteristic of type-2 diabetes. 100 organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care including

body causing cells to become energy starved. condition may impair eyes kidneys nerves and heart in long run. for study zhao together with scientists from jiao tong university in shanghai china randomly assigned patients with type-2 diabetes in two groups. control groups underwent standard patient education and dietary recommendations. experiment group on other hand were given dietary fibers to supplement their recommended diet. high fiber diet included whole grains as well as traditional chinese medicinal foods that contained high levels of dietary fibers and prebiotics that promoted growth of short chain fatty acid scfa]-producing gut bacteria. after 12 weeks researchers found that those who took high fiber diet significantly reduced their average blood glucose levels. in addition their fasting blood glucose levels also dropped and they lost more weight than those in control group. researchers also identified 15 scfa producing gut bacteria that improved after eating more dietary fibers which they attributed as key drivers of better health. in particular these bacteria became dominant strains after high fiber diet. they also boosted levels of scfas butyrate and acetate which helped reduce number of harmful bacteria in gut thanks to these two creating mildly acidic gut environment. this increased insulin production and improved blood glucose control. based on these findings zhao and team believe that study will provide new approaches to preventing and managing type-2 diabetes. our study lays foundation and opens possibility that fibers targeting this group of gut bacteria could eventually become major part of your diet and your treatment he added. some fiber rich foods to get you started fiber of course is famous for improving persons digestive health especially for his gut microbiota. its in this region that fibers are consumed by bacteria which can result in number of health related benefits. recommended daily intake rdi for men is 38 g and 25 g for women but lot of people eat way less and only consume between 15 to 17 g of fiber per day. if you re one of those people or if you just want to switch up your fiber intake in general here are some high fiber foods for your next meal. pears this popular fruit is not only tasty but it also contains 3.1 percent fiber which translates to 5.5 g in medium sized pear. avocados loaded with healthy fats and essential vitamins avocados also have 6.7 percent fiber content to match. raspberries they contain 6.5 percent fiber cup will give you about eight g of fiber. artichokes its packed with lot of nutrients and its one of worlds best sources of fiber at 5.4 percent. lentils one of most nutritious foods known to man and ridiculously inexpensive to boot lentils contain 7.9 percent fiber as well

lower diabetes risk health before it 's news. ,eating fresh fruit daily could cut risk of diabetes by 12 mail online reports. study of half million people in china found those who ate fruit daily were 12 less likely to get type 2 diabetes than those who never or rarely ate it. it was also found that people with diabetes at start of study who ate fruit regularly were slightly less likely to die or to get complications of diabetes such as eye problems diabetic retinopathy during study than those who ate fruit rarely or never. many people with diabetes in china avoid eating fruit because they are told it raises blood sugar. however study suggests fresh fruit may actually be beneficial for people with and without diabetes. fruits which release sugars more slowly into blood such as apples pears and oranges are most popular in china according to researchers. so this may be preferred option if you are worried about diabetes risk or have been diagnosed with diabetes. study does nt show that fruit directly prevents diabetes or diabetes complications as inherent limitation of this type of study is that other factors could be involved. and it does nt tell us how much fruit might be too much. overall research suggests fresh fruit can be part of healthy diet for everyone. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from university of oxford and peking university chinese academy of medical sciences china national center for food safety risk assessment non communicable disease prevention and control department and pengzhou center for disease control and prevention all in china. it was funded by kadoorie charitable foundation. study was published in peer reviewed journal plos medicine on open access basis so its free to read online. mails report was basically accurate although it did not point out that this type of study can not prove cause and effect. report confused some readers by saying that fruit does not raise blood sugar because it is metabolised differently to refined sugar. however what study found was that fruit eaters blood sugar was not on average higher than that of non fruit eaters. like most food rise in sugar levels after eating fruit is usually temporary. suns report was poorly written and contained some basic grammatical errors. what kind of research was this. this was large scale prospective cohort study. researchers wanted to look for associations between fruit eating diabetes and complications of diabetes. however while this type of study is good for spotting links it can not prove that one factor causes another. what did research involve. researchers used information from big ongoing cohort study called china kadoorie biobank study which recruited half million adults aged 30 to 79 between 2004 and 2008. participants filled in questionnaires about their health diet and lifestyle and had measurements taken of their blood sugar blood pressure cholesterol and other health related factors. diet questionnaires were repeated over course of study. after average seven years of follow up researchers looked to see how fruit consumption related to diabetes. some people in study almost 6 had diabetes at start of study. while not actually specified in study we assume majority of these cases were type 2 diabetes. type 1 diabetes usually begins in childhood and is less common than type 2. about half of them had previously been diagnosed and half were diagnosed due to their blood sugar readings taken during study. chinas disease surveillance points system was used to identify any deaths and cause of death during study. disease registries and health insurance claims were used to look into diabetes related health complications. researchers took average responses from diet questionnaires to establish how regularly people ate fruit to account for possible changes in dietary habits. they adjusted figures to take account of potential confounding factors including age age at diabetes diagnosis gender smoking alcohol consumption physical activity and body mass index. what were basic results. only 18.8 of people surveyed reported eating fruit daily and 6.4 said they never or rarely ate fruit. some 30.300 people had diabetes at start of study and there were 9.504 new cases of diabetes in seven years of follow up or 2.8 for each 1.000 people each year. people who ate fresh fruit daily were 12 less likely to develop diabetes than those who never or rarely ate fresh fruit hazard ratio hr 0.88 95 confidence interval ci 0.83 to 0.93. of people with diabetes at start of study 11.2 died during follow up 16.5 for every 1.000 people each year. people with diabetes who ate fresh fruit on three days week or more were 14 less likely to die of any cause compared to those who ate fresh fruit less than one day week hr 0.86 95 ci 0.80 to 0.94. they were also less likely to die from diabetes related causes or cardiovascular disease specifically. people with diabetes who ate fresh fruit daily were also 14 less likely to have complications of damage to their large blood vessels such as heart attack or stroke than those who ate fresh fruit never or rarely hr 0.86 95 ci 0.82 to 0.90. they were also 28 less likely to have small blood vessel complications such as eye or kidney disease hr 0.72 95 ci 0.63 to 0.83. how did researchers interpret results. researchers say their results provide strong evidence in support of current dietary guidelines that fresh fruit consumption should be recommended for all including those with diabetes. they say that people with diabetes in china eat much less fruit than people without diabetes because of concerns about sugar in fruit. they say study shows that better health education is urgently needed in china and other asian countries where diabetes is common and many people misunderstand effects of eating fresh fruit. they speculate that natural sugars in fruit may not be metabolised in same way as refined sugars although their paper did not investigate this. study findings that eating fresh fruit every day does not raise risk of diabetes and may reduce it are reassuring and in line with dietary advice in uk. its also helpful to see evidence that people who already have diabetes are likely to benefit from fresh fruit as well because there has not been much research into fruit eating for people with diabetes. however its step too far to say that fresh fruit prevents diabetes or diabetes complications. fresh fruit is just one part of healthy diet and diet is just one of things that may affect someones risk of getting diabetes. this type of study ca nt tell us whether fresh fruit actually protects against diabetes because it ca nt account for all other health and lifestyle factors involved. though it would be expected that results of this large scale study should be applicable to other populations there may be differences between people from china and other populations. this could include differences in prevalence of diabetes and its risk factors differences in healthcare for example diagnostic criteria and methods for coding health outcomes in databases and other environmental and lifestyle differences including fruit consumption. study did nt ask people which types of fruit they ate but researchers say most commonly eaten fruits in china are apples pears and oranges which release sugars more slowly into blood stream than bananas grapes and tropical fruits. its important to make distinction between whole fresh fruit which contains lots of fibre and fruit juice which is very high in sugar. previous research that we reported on in 2013 found that fruit may lower diabetes risk but fruit juice may raise it. most effective method of reducing your diabetes risk is to achieve or maintain healthy weight through combination of regular exercise and healthy eating. read more about preventing diabetes. eating fresh fruit daily could cut risk of diabetes by 12 new

guide to fasting reversing type 2 diabetes special interview with dr. jason fung.,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed your sickness. hippocrates fasting has not received as much attention as it should when it comes to world of health and medicine. that s because you ca nt really make any money off of it. pharmaceutical science studies used in medical schools to teach doctors about human health simply do nt focus enough on fasting for doctors to be knowledgable in subject. doctors also learn very little about nutrition and are trained to prescribe drugs as result. dr. jason fung is trying to change all that. toronto based nephrologist he completed medical school and internal medicine at university of toronto before finishing his nephrology fellowship at university of california los angeles at cedars sinai hospital. he joined scarborough general hospital in 2001 where he continues to practice and change peoples lives. he is one of growing number of scientists and doctors to create awareness about tremendous health benefits that can be achieved from fasting. its one of oldest dietary interventions in world and has been practiced for thousands of years. if properly practiced fasting was bad or harmful in any way as some doctors suggest it would have been known by now and studies would not be emerging showing health benefits that can be achieved from fasting regularly. for example recent study published in journal cell shows how fasting diet can trigger pancreas to regenerate itself which works to control blood sugar levels and reverse symptoms of diabetes. mark mattson one of foremost researchers of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying multiple neurodegenerative disorders like parkinsons and alzheimers disease has shown through his work that fasting can have tremendous effect on brain and could prevent or even reverse symptoms of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. you can watch great tedx talk he gave on topic here. other studies have shown how fasting actually fights cancer and triggers stem cell regeneration. you can read more about that and access those studies in article we published last year here. there is absolutely no evidence for average person that fasting can be dangerous. if you re on prescription medication or experience other medical problems then there are obviously exceptions. but its quite clear that human body was designed to go long periods of time without food and that its completely natural. why is it that normal diet is three meals day plus snacks. it is nt that its healthiest eating pattern now that s my opinion but i think there is lot of evidence to support that. there are lot of pressures to have that eating pattern there s lot of money involved. food industry are they going to make money from skipping breakfast like i did today. no they re going to lose money. if people fast food industry loses money. what about pharmaceutical industries. what if people do some intermittent fasting exercise periodically and are very healthy is pharmaceutical industry going to make any money on healthy people. dr. mark mattson taken from his tedx talk linked above dr. fung recently published book co authored with jimmy moore titled complete guide to fasting heal your body through intermittent alternate day and extended fasting its great book that puts to rest fears and myths associated with extended water fasting. he also recently published obesity code unlocking secrets of weight loss fung like 90 percent of doctors out there was conventionally oriented. he is kidney specialist and many of his patients had have type 2 diabetes as result of that. it eventually became clear to him that something was very wrong with conventional treatment of type 2 diabetes. with type 2 diabetes patients who take insulin and follow recommended dietary guidelines would still have several complications mainly kidney disease. because of this they can go blind require dialysis or even require amputations. in interview below with dr. joseph mercola dr. fung addresses multiple myths and issues that are commonly brought up about fasting. and dives into explaining how fasting does not burn muscle how it can reverse diabetes addresses starvation mode myth explains role of insulin discusses different variations of fasting and much more. be sure to visit his website where you can find information on him his practice results lectures and article that he continually publishes every month. humans live on one quarter of what they eat on other three quarters lives their doctor. egyptian pyramid inscription one recommended way of doing it which was tested by bbcs michael mosley in order to reverse his diabetes high cholesterol and other problems associated with his obesity is what is known as 5:2 diet. on 5:2 plan you cut your food down to one fourth of your normal daily calories on fasting days about 600 calories for men and about 500 for women while consuming plenty of water and tea. on other five days of week you can eat normally. another way to do it as mentioned above is to restrict your food intake between hours of 12 pm and 7 pm daily while not eating during hours outside of that time. its good to see more and more people becoming more conscious about our planet and what is happening on it its great to see more people take active role in doing some independent research and critical thinking. disease rates are skyrocketing and have been for quite some time. large portion of this can be attributed to our eating habits and all of toxic and harmful substances we put into our bodies regularly. over past few years food industry has been exposed in several ways whether its issues concerning gmos and pesticides that go with them or all of examples of pharmaceutical fraud. all of it is result of massive shift in consciousness that s happening on our planet where so much is coming to light in all aspects of our every day lives food and health is just one. fasting is also sparking interest of many because along with this consciousness shift comes awareness of world beyond our physical one. this realm deals with near death experiences quantum physics parapsychology and our overall spiritual nature and proof that s emerging that we are more than just this body and that human beings do indeed have spiritual nature. fact that modern day science in many instances is catching up to ancient wisdom is quite exciting. not only in neuroscience and quantum physics but health as well.,everyone has physician inside him or

could reverse diabetes repair pancreas new research shows. ,soviet union is well aware of benefits and applications of parapsychology research. in 1963 kremilin edict apparently gave top priority to biological research which in russia includes parapsychology. major impetus behind soviet drive to harness possible capabilities of telepathic communication telekinetics and bionics is said to come from soviet military and kgb. today it is reported that ussr has twenty or more centres for study of parapsychological phenomena with annual budget estimated in 1967 at over 13 million dollars and reported to be as high as 21 million dollars. soviet parapsychology research was actually stimulated by 1960 french story concerning us atomic submarine nautilus. french journalists splashed now rather infamous nautilus story in headlines us navy uses esp on atomic sub. ship to shore telepathy according to french blipped along nicely even when nautilus was far under water. is telepathy new secret weapon. will esp be deciding factor in future warfare. speculating french sensationalized has american military learned secret of mind power. in leningrad nautilus reports went off like depth charge in mind of l.l vasilev. above information comes from this declassified cia document. it goes on to mention that in april of 1960 dr. leonid leonidovich vasiliev addressed group of high ranking soviet scientists stating as you can see telepathy and parapsychology which include remote viewing esp and psychokinesis have all been studied in depth within black budget special access programs in multiple countries. these programs are often highly classified and so whatever has been revealed in official documentation is only tip of iceberg. sometimes declassification of documents is used to halt more questioning into phenomenon. stargate program is great example of that in united states. although documents that were declassified show some startling findings like fact that remote viewing is real and that it was used for intelligence collecting purposes its safe to assume that many details of this program remain highly classified. russel targ was co founder of that program. heres video of him sharing everything he knows about esp. crazy thing about parapsychology is fact that studies have yielded statistically significant results. i m talking about hundreds if not thousands of studies that have been conducted worldwide have seen positive results. many of these results are just as strong if not stronger than lot of results that come from hard sciences like physics and mechanical engineering. department of defence has openly stated that phenomena within this realm is real despite fact that they are still somewhat inexplicable. as far back as 1999 head of statistics department at uc irvine jessica utts published paper showing results dealing with parapsychology and mind body connection are lot stronger than results used to approve some of our medications. again most of what s known is still protected and locked up by black budget world. documents referenced above are also decades old so just imagine what s happened or what s been discovered since then. documents also outline how these experiments were not limited to earth. soviet research into biocommunications phenomena does not appear to be earth bound and limited to inner space but apparently extends to outer space as well. so called father of soviet rocketry k.e tsiolkovsky stated that in coming era of space flights telepathic abilities are necessary. while space rocket must bring men toward knowledge of grand secrets in universe study of psychic phenomena can lead us toward knowledge of mysteries of human mind. it is precisely solution of this secret which promises greatest achievements. source there are reports that soviets are training their cosmonauts in telepathy to back up their electronic equipment while in outer space. one of these back up schemes is known to involve coded telepathic messages. this method was previously demonstrated in march 1967 when coded telepathic message was flashed from moscow to leningrad. involvement of astronauts or cosmonauts in telepathy experiments is not necessarily unprecedented. in february 1971 during apollo 14 flight to moon astronaut edgar mitchell made 150 separate attempts to project his thoughts from inside space capsule back to individual on earth. results of apollo 14 experiments have been well documented in detail and are published in journal of parapsychology. source mitchell used 25 numbered cards in experiment in which he attempted to send thought message to four people regarding symbols on each card. he said two of four got 51 of 200 correct and other two were less successful. source dr. elizabeth rauscher world renowned physicist researcher and presenter who has done lot of work for nasa among several other organizations has admitted that quantum entanglement experiments have also successfully been carried out from earth to space. although above mentioned phenomena is very intriguing especially soviet part we have to remember that there is still lot of information that has not been disclosed yet. this is not really studied openly in mainstream academia yet its only really studied at highest levels of government. i published well sourced article providing multiple examples from cia document that confirm existence of humans with special abilities who are able to do impossible things. you can access that here. its very interesting and goes to show just how strong results in field of parapsychology are and what information may still be kept hidden from us. today hundreds of scientists are coming together to emphasize that physical matter is not our only reality. they ve created manifesto and you can find links and access more information about this initiative which started few years ago in article we published here. there is entire non physical world out there for us to study. point is that this stuff is very real and has been studied for long time. heres interesting quote from literature regarding remote viewing one subject within realm of parapsychology that allows person to view other people or objects in different locations regardless of distance heres telling quote from some of declassified literature one participant of program remote viewer ingo swann was tasked with job of taking look at what could be going on off planet. why do we still ridicule parapsychology. its correlated with quantum physics and it seems to be next logical step for science. fact that this type of study is not included within mainstream media is truly shame and its not fair that government agencies are only ones who seem to be actively and heavily engaged in this type of study. at end of they day no skeptic can deny reality of parapsychological phenomena.,according to new study published in journal cell new fasting diet might be able toreboot body. research explains that diet triggers pancreas to regenerate itself which works to control blood sugar levelsand reverse symptoms of diabetes. scientists put mice into artificial fasting mode for four days.

diabetes. ,dr mercolawe have epidemic of diabetes in united states. estimated 30.3 million americans nearly 1 in 10 have type 2 diabetes.1another 84 million american adults about 1 in 3 are prediabetic and most are unaware of this fact. prediabetes2 is defined as elevation in blood glucose over 100 milligrams per deciliter mg dl but lower than 125 mg dl at which point it formally becomes type 2 diabetes. however any fasting blood sugar regularly over 90 mg dl really suggests insulin resistance and seminal work by late dr. joseph kraft author of diabetes epidemic and you should everyone be tested. suggests that 80 percent 8 out of 10 americans are in fact insulin resistant.3 which means they re already on their way toward developing diabetes. that s bad news. good news is type 2 diabetes is curable and cure is less than free. it actually saves you loads of time and money. in his book diabetes code prevent and reverse type 2 diabetes naturally dr. jason fung details how to address this exceptionally common problem. fung is nephrologist kidney specialist with practice in toronto. two years ago i interviewed him about fasting which is one of most powerful interventions for type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. fung was also one of experts who peer reviewed my book fat for fuel which integrates some of his work. why identifying insulin resistance is so important there are two types of diabetes type 1 or insulin dependent diabetes and type 2 diabetes which is lifestyle related. type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all diabetes cases and is topic of this particular discussion. prevalence of type 2 diabetes started to rise in 1980s at time when obesity had yet to become significant trend. however as obesity became more prevalent so did type 2 diabetes. ultimately diabetes is just one symptom. insulin resistance which results in mitochondrial dysfunction is also at heart of cancer heart disease alzheimers and other degenerative diseases and it all starts because your body is unable to burn fat as primary fuel. when your body relies primarily on sugar instead more reactive oxygen species ros are generated which damage mitochondria in your cells. why fasting resolves insulin resistance cause of diabetes fasting has been used for thousands of years to keep us well. once you understand what insulin resistance actually is and what type 2 diabetes is then you ll understand why something so simple as abstaining from food for period of time can be such powerful intervention. contrary to infectious diseases you can not treat metabolic disease with pill because metabolic diseases such as diabetes are predicated on lifestyle primarily diet. as explained by fung to avoid adding sugar into your body it is important to adopt cyclical low carb high fat diet which i detail in fat for fuel. then to burn off sugar already in your system intermittent fasting or time restricted eating is powerful tool. exercise is not solution for diabetes and can not replace fasting. remember you ca nt out exercise your mouth. reason for this is because you not only have insulin resistance in your muscles but in all your tissues and organs and to eliminate excess glucose in your organs you need to temporarily starve cells. clearly you should exercise but that will only burn glycogen in your muscles. its not going to address your fatty liver. as noted by fung fasting gets rid of all sort of excess nutrients. that s why historically people called it cleanse or detox because that s really what it is. in his practice fung has used fasting for many years and can attest to dramatic turnarounds possible. we have people coming in with most severe diabetes they re taking hundreds of units of insulin day and within three to four weeks we have them off everything. oftentimes severe diabetic can revert back to being nondiabetic within as little as two months. this is not to say its easy. fasting can be difficult when you re used to eating multiple times day. but its natural way that will allow your body to heal itself. meanwhile taking insulin for type 2 diabetes is about worst thing you can do. as explained by fung fasting is most profoundly effective metabolic intervention i m aware of. its like getting free stem cell transplant and it massively upregulates autophagy and mitophagy. it also stimulates mitochondrial biosynthesis during refeeding phase which allows your body to naturally regenerate. for these reasons fasting is not only beneficial for type 2 diabetes and obesity but also for health in general and likely even longevity. there s even evidence to suggest fasting can help prevent or even reverse dementia as it helps your body clean out toxic debris. as noted by fung its fundamentally one of keys of wellness. by lowering insulin you also increase other important hormones including growth hormone aka fitness hormone which is important for muscle development and general vitality. other ailments that can benefit from fasting include polycystic ovaries polycystic kidneys and fast growing cancer cells. reason for this is because when autophagy increases your body starts breaking down old protein including fast growing cells. then during refeeding phase growth hormone increases boosting rebuilding of new proteins and cells. in other words it reactivates and speeds up your bodys natural renewal cycle. most people fear being hungry and avoid it like plague. here intermittent fasting can make process lot easier. before i tried my first five day water fast i increased my intermittent daily fasting to point that i was fasting for 20 hours day for few months but one month is likely sufficient. at that point going several days without food was easy since my body had had gained metabolic flexibility and was able to burn fat as my primary fuel most people get really hungry by day three on water fast yet i had no hunger at all. fung agrees saying gradually easing into longer fasts will naturally minimize most side effects associated with fasting as will transitioning over to high fat low carb diet to help your body to adjust to using fat as primary fuel. so called keto flu is often related to sodium deficiency so its recommended to take high quality unprocessed salt each day. i typically pour salt in my hand and lick it throughout day when fasting as i obviously ca nt put it on food. this will also help reduce likelihood of intractable muscle cramps at night. headaches are also common when you first start water fasting. these too can often be minimized by taking salt. alternative to eating salt straight or putting it in water is to add it to bit of bone broth. another important mineral is magnesium. its particularly important if you are diabetic as magnesium deficiency is very common among type 2 diabetics. this is another possible culprit if you re getting muscle cramps. there are several types of magnesium some of which are more poorly absorbed than others. during water fasting your best bet is to use epsom salt baths as this allows your body to absorb magnesium through your skin rather than your digestive tract. magnesium has laxative effect in high doses and when you re not eating anything oral magnesium can easily result in disaster pants. multivitamins can also be useful during extended fasts especially if you re doing them regularly. it is also important to understand that if you are on multiday water fast you will liberate many toxins from your fat stores so using infrared sauna and taking effective binders like chlorella modified citrus pectin cilantro or even activated charcoal can help eliminate these liberated toxins from your body and prevent their reabsorption. work with knowledgeable physician if you re on any medications while fasting is profoundly effective intervention for type 2 diabetes you do need to use caution if you re diabetic. if you are taking medication especially for your blood sugar you have to make sure you talk to your doctor because there s risk your blood sugar may end up dipping too low. if you re taking insulin and keep taking insulin while fasting you could get into trouble. why you need not fear starvation last but not least one of greatest fears people have about fasting is concept of starvation and loss of lean muscle mass. in his book fung explains why such fears are overblown. your metabolic rate is energy your body uses to generate body heat and keep your organs working. your body basically needs certain number of calories day. people have tendency to think that skipping meal means your metabolic rate will decrease. in reality exact opposite occurs. in studies looking at basal metabolic rate peoples metabolic rate is actually 10 percent higher at end of four day fast than at beginning. so your body is not shutting down its actually ramping itself up. reason for this has to do with counterregulatory hormones. as insulin drops counterregulatory hormones go up. some of these activate your sympathetic nervous system so called fight or flight response. so as you fast all these hormones are going up your sympathetic nervous system is going up your adrenaline is going up your growth hormones going up fung says. if you re among 80 percent of people who are insulin resistant get yourself copy of fungs brand new book that comes out april 3 diabetes code prevent and reverse type 2 diabetes naturally. fungs book complete guide to fasting is another excellent resource. as fung says we ve known that fasting is beneficial for thousands of years. we just strayed away from it and we need to re embrace this foundational aspect of health.,dr mercolawe have epidemic of diabetes in united states. estimated 30.3 million americans nearly 1 in

do not cause diabetes new study has serious flaws health before it 's news. ,no gluten free diets do not cause diabetes new study has serious flaws of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. take look at some headlines that have been flooding internet recently gluten free diets may be tied to increased risk of type 2 diabetes going gluten free may raise your risk of type 2 diabetes gluten free diets could lead to deficiencies and cause illness low gluten diet may be linked to diabetes risk gluten may be healthier for you than you think going gluten free might actually increase your risk of diabetes what were your first thoughts upon reading those headlines. did they make you think that avoiding gluten will increase your risk of developing one of most dangerous chronic conditions that plagues humanityand that maybe consuming gluten is actually good for you. heres source those articles used as reference low gluten diets may be associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes there are many problems with this claimfirst this is nt study that is publishedanywhere. study itself is filled with flaws but none of mainstream media outlets seemed to notice. all of them stuck with narrative that was given. none questioned veracity of claims made. study comes from harvard researchers which may sound impressive but they do nt always get things right. i m not saying they are always wrong butharvard scientists are largely to blame for decades long fear of fat trend that led people to believe that dietary fat causes disease. they also downplayed role sugar plays in development of heart disease. excerpt from my article big sugar paid harvard scientists to tell big fat lies about heart disease summarizes scandal now lets define what gluten is it is also important to explain condition related to gluten called celiac disease because it is relevant to this story now back to this new study lets take look at flaws and oh boy there are many. i hope you noticed few red flags in that passage. first researchers based their study on dietary recall questionnaires that were completed by participants. those kinds of questionnaires are notoriously unreliable. researchers estimated gluten intake based on those self reported assessments. this is casually mentioned in press release while their study size was massive -199.794 people is lot it still did not establish cause effect relationship. at best this kind of review can only suggest potential association but this particular study did nt even achieve that ill explain why later in article. in popular science article gluten free diets are not actually linked to diabetes sara chodosh elaborates lets look at another passage from press release cereal fiber. why did they specify cereal fiber and not justfiber. it is interesting choice of words especially considering that majority of research supporting benefits of dietary fiber come from epidemiological studies that link consumption of fiber rich fruits and vegetables with lowered risk of certain diseases such as obesity heart disease and cancer particularly colon cancer. and when tested in lab controlled intervention trials that simply add fiber supplements to otherwise consistent diet have not shown these protective effects. fruits vegetables nuts and seeds are all excellent sources of fiber in varying degrees. in addition they all naturally contain far more nutrients than cereal or other grain based foods especially processed ones. so one ca nt help but wonder why these researchers failed to point that out. also why did geng zong ph.d one of researchers say this. what does he mean by gluten free foods. that is not specified in press release. i ca nt help but wonder if this is intentionally misleading. why not say something like people without celiac disease or heck everyone may consider consuming more fruits vegetables nuts and seeds to increase their intake of dietary fiber and other micronutrients and to prevent chronic disease and diabetes. this is strange too if researchers truly believe that people who do nt consume enough cereal fiber might be at higher risk of developing diabetes then why not recommend gluten free grains that are high in fiber like quinoa amaranth buckwheat sorghum gluten free oats and teff. why did they specifically refer to gluten intake. gluten itself is not form of fiber it is protein. hmm. i wonder if push to consume gluten has anything to do with fact that for big pharma and others who profit from unhealthy humans type 2 diabetes is goldmine. ironically in 2016 harvard shared press release with following headline type 2 diabetes is largely caused by lifestyle factors and is therefore avoidable controllable and even reversible in most cases. for majority of people type 2 diabetes and sometimes type 1 is caused by very dietary advice experts have been giving for decades as dr. davis explains in diabetes inc cutting dietary fat and cholesterolas advised u.s. department of health and human services usda american diabetes association american heart association and academy of nutrition and dietetics increased consumption of grainsthat raise blood sugar higher than table sugar as also advised by same agencies big food and soft drink industrywho have made high carb grain based products and soft drinks centerpiece of their business model while paying same above agencies experts to divert attention away from carbs and sugar and advocate silly notions like everything in moderation in fact if you want to avoid type 2 diabetes avoiding grains and gluten. altogether is great idea. speaking of diabetes and avoiding gluten this is certainly interesting emphasis mine if those study participants were strictly following gluten free diet as people with celiac disease need to do thenperhaps we can speculate that avoiding gluten is what protected them from developing type 2 diabetes. its just idea intriguing one i think. what else were people who were studied eating or not eating. that crucial bit of information is not shared with us. also and this is big problem researchers did not specifically study people on gluten free diets. they only studied associations between eating less gluten and developing diabetes. they even admit this in press release researchers claim 13 difference in type 2 diabetes incidence but that is minor especially considering inherent flaws associated with epidemiological studies. as dr. william davis explains confident associations are typically much larger than this 40 or 50 for instance. this does not stop of course media people who are journalists at best paid marketing people for grain industry at worst to propagate their misinterpretations. all of this does raise important question could avoiding gluten lead to development of type 2 diabetes. definitely if you replace products that contain gluten with substitutes that are made with cornstarch rice flour tapioca starch and potato flour. there are plenty of gluten free junk foods on market cookies brownies cupcakes crackers chips bagels breads pancakes waffles muffins you name it you can probably find gluten free version. of course many of these food items are also filled with sugarand i think by now everyone knows sugar is linked with development of type 2 diabetes and long list of other chronic debilitating diseases. in beginning of press release researchers make claim that there is lack of evidence that reducing gluten consumption provides long term health benefits. i guess they have nt been keeping up with research. maybe they should take look at these studies intestinal cell damage and systemic immune activation in individuals reporting sensitivity to wheat in absence of coeliac disease my article on this study trust your

gluten free diets is associated with changes in intestinal microbiome new study links protein in wheat to inflammation of chronic health conditions dietary intake of wheat and other cereal grains and their role in inflammation gluten causes gastrointestinal symptoms in subjects without celiac disease double blind randomized placebo controlled trial there are many more. many people believe that gluten free is silly diet trend and that there s not thing wrong with consuming products that contain gluten. its become fashionable to mock and belittle people who do nt have official celiac diagnosis but decide to live gluten free lifestyle anyway. but celiac disease is nt only problem associated with gluten. some have wheat allergies and now researchers are trying to determine how to best diagnose people with recently identified condition called non celiac gluten sensitivity. from paper spectrum of gluten related disorders consensus on new nomenclature and classification i have few thoughts on this one why do those people care what other people eat dont eat. is it somehow threat to them. two why would people voluntarily restrict their diets if they were nt actually feeling better and noticing improvements in health. i am one of people who feels infinitely better on gluten and grain free diet and i know many others. three products that contain gluten are not necessary for health anyway. there s not thing in them that you ca nt get from other dietary sources. four so what if there are lack of studies that prove particular food ingredient is bad for us. does it really matter. if person feels better on certain kind of diet who is anyone else to say they are wrong. in article how to avoid clickbait on nutrition studies kamal patel writes what does this mean for you. if you believe you may have celiac disease it is important to consult with your healthcare provider because of seriousness of disorder blazing path to natural health and wellness. get natural

preventable and reversible condition alternative before it 's news. ,title of this article may sound like heresy to those who have been schooled to believe that when diabetes happens to you it is with you for life. there is far more to story than both drug and naturally based palliative medicine normally touches upon. according to american diabetes association ada statistics diabetes now afflicts 25.8 million americans or 8.3 of our population. only 5 of diabetics are type 1 where through autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells they are told they have lifelong dependence on insulin. rest are classified as type 2 resulting from insulin resistance cells of body stop responding to insulin combined in some cases with insulin deficiency. additionally according to ada 1 in every 4 americans have pre diabetes or 79 million. while geneticists apply vast amounts of time energy and money to finding causes of disease in our genes much less attention is placed on well known triggers of autoimmunity such as infections vaccines pesticide and petroleum exposure diesel fuel particles and consumption of foods like wheat cow milk and soy unfermented gmo and/or excessive are major contributing factors in development of type 1 diabetes. additionally consumption of high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oil and basic deficiencies of omega-3 fatty acids magnesium and chromium contribute to development of type 2 diabetes. blaming bad genes on diseases like diabetes is convenient way to escape obvious things we can do individually and as culture to prevent escalation of already epidemic problem. we should nt settle for unlikely prospect of future cure via pharmaceutical pipeline gene therapy stem cell research or similar high priced technological endeavors when cause and therefore cure of diabetes may be as close to us as what is at end of our fork. it is accepted truth that type 1 diabetes involves immune system attacking insulin producing beta cells in pancreas. subsequent damage to pancreas leads to reduced capacity to produce insulin. while geneticist look for bad genes that are supposedly causing autoimmune problem it is well documented that in susceptible individuals something in wheat known as gliadin for instance stimulates diabetogenic class ii hla antigens on surface of pancreatic islet cells cells that normally do no display these antigens marking them for autoimmune destruction. do dietary lectins cause disease. bmj. also dark side of wheat. not everyone who eats wheat will develop diabetes. different people will exhibit differing degrees of susceptibility to wheat proteins and this is why it is right to say that there is genetic component to development of type 1 diabetes or to any disease. but acknowledging existence of genetic differences and differing susceptibilities to illness in population is not to say that genes are causing disease read my short essay on why genes do nt cause disease here. in case of wheat protein gliadin it is not gene that is causing islet cell to present antigen on its surface. it takes wheat gliadin to activate genes necessary for this cellular transformation. to use analogy genes predisposing one to higher risk for diabetes are like unloaded gun. bullets are certain antigenic foods like wheat cows dairy and unfermented gmo and/or excessive soy. triggers that fire this loaded gun are varied from prolonged exposure to these foods to increased intestinal gut permeability vaccinations viral infections pesticide and chemical exposures and perhaps multitude of as of yet unknown factors. if we know that two most commonly lauded health foods cows milk products and wheat are implicated in development of type 1 diabetes would nt it be good idea to remove them from diets of our young as precaution. what is other alternative. succumb to fatalistic fallacies of gene theory of disease and just hope that our children wo nt develop disease because they do not have bad gene or have just been lucky in game of nutritional russian roulette. even after beta cells in pancreas have experienced significant levels of destruction and there is now insufficient insulin to keep blood sugar below toxic levels medical establishment pretends like bodys self healing and regenerative abilities do nt exist. every minute 60.000 cells in our body are reborn and over course of 100 days all approximately 17 trillion are replaced by new cells. if one can remove causes of autoimmune self destruction by clearing infections removing diabetogenic foods correcting mineral and vitamin deficiencies and imbalances shifting tissue and blood ph back from dangerously acidic levels and supplementing diet with proven beta cell regenerating foods herbs or nutrients pancreas in some cases can regenerate beta cell function. see list of beta cell regenerators here. learn more at wikipedia on c peptide ideally good endocrinologist or clinician will test for c peptide levels moment s)he is confronted with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic. proinsulin precursor to insulin produced by your beta cells is composed of three parts two insulin side chains named and b and peptide holding two together known as c. once proinsulin is enzymatically degraded by beta cells and its constituent parts released into serum to do their job it splits off into three separate parts leaving c peptide as accurate marker of just how much insulin diabetic body is producing. taking baseline reading at beginning of treatment establishes pancreas level of health insofar as it reflects its remaining capacity to produce insulin. instead of blindly throwing synthetically produced insulin at problem which through negative feedback loop may cause beta cell regeneration to flounder or cause further atrophy of those cells bare minimum of insulin should be used while encouraging diabetic pancreas to come back on line with more of its own production. also natural substances could be used that protect remaining beta cells from further degeneration. moreover form of insulin being passed on as bioidentical with misleading names like humulin and humolog is byproduct of recombinant dna technology. all prescribed forms on market including lantus come from gmo e. coli bacteria which produce form which is not as compatible with human body as once universally available bovine or porcine forms. access to glandular extracts have been barred in us mostly due to drug company pressures you can order these animal forms from canada over internet. if drug companies and their enforcers fda have their way all bio identicals and/or animal glandulars will be made illegal or unavailable in future including armour thyroid in favor of levothyroxine. ultimately type 1 diabetes can be prevented. even after there is established damage to pancreas much of damage can be reversed. these words may be heretical to conventional medical establishment but absolutely rudimentary from perspective of basic biology and enlightened nutrition. type 2 diabetes and pre diabetic state of insulin resistance that precedes it are caused by following preventable factors 1 excessive consumption of empty calories. 2 inactivity lack of exercise. 3 consumption of hidden sweets which are high glycemic foods that do nt taste sweet but make blood sweet e.g pasta cereal crackers. excess sugar but even worse.high fructose corn syrup and other sources of concentrated fructose e.g. agave. 4 hydrogenated oils. 5 nutritional deficiencies of minerals especially magnesium chromium and zinc and omega 3 fatty acids as found in foods like flaxseed walnuts and wild fish. 6 chemical exposures including environmental pollution e.g. pesticides and drugs e.g. various prescribed and over counter drugs. one of basic mechanisms of insulin resistant hyperglycemia type 2 diabetes is as follows when we eat beyond our capacity excess energy is stored in body as glycogen and saturated fat. when through prolonged over consumption of food our body no longer has room to store these unneeded calories insulin resistance emerges. in order to protect from over nutrition fat and muscle cells begin to lose number of insulin receptors and/or loose function thus reducing amount of glucose that may enter. this causes blood sugar to raise to unhealthy levels leaving pancreas with no other option than to overcompensate and produce more insulin. resultant elevation of insulin levels can cause number of adverse cardiovascular neurological and endocrine effects. if this cycle continues eventually insulin producing beta cells may become exhausted and lose their ability to produce insulin resulting in double diabetes where you have low insulin and high blood sugar as well as insulin resistance. caloric restriction especially carbohydrates becomes of vital importance in forestalling development of type 2 diabetes. exercise is essential in helping body use up stored energy converting calories consumed into calories burned. exercise has opposite effect of over eating increasing number of insulin receptors in muscle and increasing sensitivity of body to insulin thus releasing pancreas of burden of constant insulin production. exercise also results in release of appetite suppressing hormones and neurotransmitters which help to forestall over eating. carbohydrates generally have insulin secreting effect on body because they have high glycemic rating relative to proteins and fat. that is to say carbohydrates cause blood to become sweeter than protein or fat which are broken down slowly in body independently of insulin. even so called complex carbohydrates like puffed rice have higher glycemic ratings 110 than white sugar 80 which is itself 50 fructose and therefore less likely to induce insulin response than these whole grains. on flip side fructose while having low glycemic rating can raise blood sugar on back end by reducing affinity of insulin for its receptor contributing to insulin resistance and elevating blood glucose. fructose also undergoes glycation caramelization much more readily than other carbohydrates which contributes to much of morbility and mortality associated with elevated blood sugar. when it comes to whole grains no food category is associated with greater misunderstanding in realm of blood sugar disorders. perception that whole grains are good for our health and should be consumed in plenty is based on assumption that millions of years of biological evolution that preceded advent of agrarian revolution circa 10.000 b.c. are no longer relevant. we spent 300.000 years as archaic homo sapiens in capacity of hunters gatherers and foragers where consumption of cereal grasses and especially seed form of these grasses would not have occurred with any regularity if at all excepting starvation pressures. our metabolism is simply not designed for large amounts of starch sugar and synthetically produced sweeteners and fats. we need fruits vegetables seeds and nuts and high quality sources of protein in plenty. evidence exists demonstrating that glycoproteins in starchy grains known as lectins can bind to leptin receptors in hypothalamus blocking out appetite suppressing effects of hormone leptin. this is one reason why bread pasta cereal crackers etc. can generate incessant cravings and contribute to condition known as leptin resistance. wheat lectin also has affinity for insulin receptors in body which could result in both insulin receptor stimulation based weight gain and/or insulin resistance and which explains why it is used to get cattle to slaughter weight quicker. high fructose corn syrup hfcs and purified fructose have both been shown to cause insulin resistance in rats and humans. there are in fact over 70 other adverse health effects linked to purified fructose consumption. hydrogenated oils also dramatically reduce responsiveness of our muscle and fat to insulin whereas omega 3 fatty acids increase that responsiveness. to view our extensive data archive on subject on potentially beneficial substances dietary considerations and relevance of drug and environmental chemical exposures in

foods high in antioxidants health before it 's news.,this devastating condition shows no sign of slowing down any time soon. in fact world health organization predicts that nearly 600 million adults will develop diabetes by year 2035. and as scientists continue to search for more effective methods of prevention and treatment new study reveals that diet of foods high in antioxidants such as fresh fruit vegetables and teas significantly lowers risk of type 2 diabetes. intelligent study reveals type 2 diabetes can be avoided with right kind of diet fruits and vegetables contain phytonutrients or plant chemicals known as flavonoids. these natural compounds have powerful antioxidant effects that allow them to scavenge harmful free radicals and reduce oxidative damage that contributes to disease. extensive studies have explored anti diabetic benefits of individual antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables but researchers took slightly different tack for this study. in order to get more comprehensive view of relationship between food and diabetes they examined benefit of overall high antioxidant diet. 15-year study published in diabetologia journal of european association for study of diabetes involved over 65.000 women between ages of 40 and 65. upon analyzing questionnaires filled out by participants researchers found that women with highest amounts of antioxidants in their diets enjoyed 27 percent reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes very substantial benefit. scientists reported that odds of diabetes diminished as antioxidant consumption increased and noted that antioxidant capacity may play important role in reducing risk of diabetes in middle aged women. in other words consistently making series of simple healthy dietary choices can dramatically lower risk of potentially life threatening and costly disease. secret to success antioxidants work at molecular level to fight diabetes latest study is not only research showing amazing effects of dietary flavonoids. researchers at harvard school of public health found that anthocyanins in blueberries significantly lowered risk of type 2 diabetes. and in study published in nutrition and metabolism in 2015 researchers set out to evaluate biological action and therapeutic potential of dozens of dietary flavonoids and anthocyanins and concluded by stating unequivocally that phytochemicals protected against diabetes. team reported that flavonoids worked against diabetes by helping to maintain blood glucose levels promoting glucose uptake and stimulating insulin production from beta cells of pancreas. in addition flavonoids improved performance of fat burning enzymes while decreasing harmful ldl cholesterol and reducing levels of pro inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin. and they significantly raised levels of pair of antioxidant disease fighting enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione. they also helped to decrease advanced glycation end products. ages are toxins that can trigger and worsen diabetes. list of anti diabetic benefits from flavonoids is truly stunning. it is hard to believe that ordinary apple or bowl of blueberries can harbor this type of disease fighting therapeutic potential but scientific research has shown it to be true. fresh fruits and vegetables offer up rich bounty of flavonoids virtually all fruits and vegetables are good sources of antioxidant flavonoids. and these compounds have synergistic effect meaning that they complement and potentiate each others powers. apples grapes and onions are rich in flavonoid quercetin while citrus fruits offer up flavonoids hesperidin tangeritin kaempferol and naringenen. cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale contain kaempferol and luteolin while blueberries and other purplish blue plant foods are your best bet for obtaining anthocyanins beneficial plant pigments with anti diabetic effects. anthocyanins are also found in cranberries cherries blackberries currants raspberries and mulberries as well as in purple grapes red cabbage and eggplant skins. orange vegetables such as carrots and squash contain healthy amounts of beta carotene. bonus fresh fruits and vegetables tend to be high in vitamin c which is itself potent antioxidant. they are also naturally high in dietary fiber which can help ward off obesity that contributes to diabetes. enlist fresh organic fruits and vegetables as your first line of defense against diabetes roster of foods that can help you fight diabetes is extensive and delicious. in addition to foods already listed flavonoid packed fare to put on menu includes plums prunes walnuts strawberries parsley celery onions peppers eggplants green leafy vegetables and hazelnuts. antioxidant rich beverages include teas black green and chamomile red wine in moderation and coffee which has been shown in studies to protect against type 2 diabetes. naturally it would be best to choose organic varieties to avoid unwanted exposure to toxic chemicals used in growing process of most commercial brands. for maximum antioxidant benefit experts recommend eating fruits and vegetables raw lightly steamed or sauted. however since antioxidant capacity of carrots and celery increases when they are lightly cooked steaming them is smart choice. researchers have long reported that diets high in fruits and vegetables are strongly associated with lower risk of developing heart disease and cancer two leading causes of death in united states. now thanks to latest studies we know that putting fresh fruits and vegetables on menu can help us take aim at another deadly disease as well.,naturalhealth365 type 2 diabetes which affects well over 350 million people worldwide has reached epidemic proportions. conservatively speaking 1 in 10 u.s. adults has type 2 diabetes and western medicine offers little hope. for example does anyone really believe that taking insulin pills is best way to resolve blood ....

this story is fact. add your two cents. chaste tree berry may have potential in improved pancreatic islet regeneration and hepatic insulin sensitivity for cure of type i and ii diabetes some scientists suggested. diabetes are condition caused by insufficient insulin entering bloodstream in regulation of glucose. diseases are either caused by cells in pancreas dying off or receptor sites clogged up by fat and cholesterol. in some cases diabetes is also caused by allergic reaction of cells in immune system. cause of type 1 diabetes in unknown however it is result of immune system mistakenly destroys insulin producing islet or islets of langerhans cells in pancreas. mystery is why immune system attached specific insulin producing cells in pancreas. recent study suggested that immune system does not destroy entire colony of insulin producing cells in pancreas but reduced numbers of existence and function in production of insulin. in other words according to exeter clinical research facility in study of 74 volunteers. by measurement of how much natural insulin of tested subjects produced as responded to meals researchers found that 73 per cent of islet produced very low levels of insulin. chaste tree berry is species of vitex agnus castus genus vitex belongings to family lamiaceae native to mediterranean region. herbal medicine has been used for thousands of year as anaphrodisiac herb and considered as queen herb in treating menstrual problems and discomforts. in study to test two water soluble extracts aqueous and ethanolic obtained from leaves of vitex doniana researchers at ahmadu bello university launched investigation to test whether these extracts exerting any protection of pancreas against normal and streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. according to results of experiment application of extracts of chaste tree berry displayed significant effects in increased volume density of pancreatic islet as well as percentage of -cells and size of islet in compared to non treated diabetic control which showed complete degeneration of islet cells. treated rats also showed reduction p<0.05 in serum activities of marker enzymes alanine aminotransferase(alt aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase in diabetes treated rats in healthy individuals alt levels in blood are low but serum increase substantially in patients with diabetes caused by liver damage in decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity. high levels of alanine aminotransferase is marker of decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and predictor of onset of type 2 diabetes. in compared to healthy individuals alkaline phosphatase alp enzyme has been found to elevate in diabetes patients. furthermore injection of extract of chaste tree berry also lowered serum of total bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin which were found to associate negatively to onset of diabetes. these results of differentiation indicated that extracts of chaste tree berry exert liver protective effect of treatment group against diabetics in induction of decreased hepatic insulin sensitivity and normalized pancreas function in production of insulin through restoring numbers of scattering islet cells. application of extracts also induced regeneration and repairing of damaged islet cells in pancreas. dr. oche o lead researcher said plant extracts exhibited regeneration of -cells along with -cells repairs in compared to non treated diabetic control which showed complete degeneration of islet cells. more important in d galactose induced pancreatic disorder in aging mouse model treatment of vitex agnus castus vac demonstrated potential pancreatic protective and hypoglycemic effects through improved size of pancreatic islets decreased in aged and d galactose groups. in total of 72 adult female naval medical research institute nmri mice weighing 30 35 g divided into 6 groups of control vac hydroalcoholic extract d galactose d galactose vac hydroalcoholic extract aged aged vac hydroalcoholic extract through subcutaneous injection of d galactose for 45 days and vac hydroalcoholic extract gavaged twice day in last 7 days. 24 h after last drug and extract administrations group treated with chaste tree berry extract or combinations of extract showed increased evels of insulin and decreased serum glucose and d galactose level in compared to other treatment groups. study also found despite size of pancreatic islets decreased in aged and d galactose groups .. vac hydroalcoholic extract has hypoglycemic and pancreatic protective effects in natural aged and aging model mice. in fact there is also report indicated that oral administration of once daily to diabetic rats for period of 30 days of iridoid glucoside isolated from chaste tree berry may be effective as glibenclamide known hypoglycemic drug at concentration of 50 mg kg b.w. promissingly iridoid glucoside reversed hyperglycemia induced biochemical changes to near normal levels. collectively chaste tree berry may be used as functional food for curing type i and type ii diabetes through its hypoglycemic and pancreatic and hepatic protective effects. however further data collection on studies performed with human consumption during course of disease will be necessary to complete picture of its antidiabetes possibilities. intake of chaste tree berry extracts should be taken with extreme care as overdoses may

important. ,if you have more lean muscle tissue you have less risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus t2 dm findings outlined by us and chinese scientists provide further insights into how muscles use glucose in feedback loop as well as its role in whole body glucose balance. we found that skeletal muscle cells have machinery to directly sense glucose in certain sense its like muscles can taste sugar too said senior study author dr jiandie lin faculty member at university of michigan life sciences institute commenting on his study published in molecular cell. majority of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented by adoption of healthier lifestyle reported researchers led by dr. frank hu of harvard school of public health in boston massachusetts. tom hanks blames himself for type 2 diabetes diagnosis knows he can reverse it naturally raised blood glucose levels post meal is main symptom of t2 dm. elevated high blood sugar levels long term hyperglycaemia can lead to serious health issues such as nerve damage or kidney failure. one study looked at 13.600 people and followed them for 6 years. researchers found that people who had just 10 greater amount of muscle tissue in their body according to special bioelectrical impedance measurement had 12 less chance of developing pre diabetes or diabetes type ii. diabetes prevention program dpp trial published in 2002 found intensive lifestyle interventions such as diet or exercise were more effective than diabetes drug metformin in preventing onset of type 2 diabetes. reporting in 2011 september issue of journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism researchers from david geffen school of medicine at ucla suggest there is correlation between greater muscle mass relative to body size and substantially decreased risk of developing metabolic changes that lead to diabetes. contributions of glucose sensing pathway in skeletal muscle by silencing important gene baf60c in cell cultures and in laboratory mice. team from university of michigan and zhejiang university in china began looking at contributions of glucose sensing pathway in skeletal muscle by silencing important gene baf60c in cell cultures and in laboratory mice. along with gene hdac5 baf60c is thought to indirectly activate enzyme akt and promotes glycolysis in muscle cells. some of these mice were fed high fat diet to induce obesity. later they developed trouble disposing of additional glucose after meal. currently accepted insulin mechanism was not sufficient to process glucose on its own. we found that molecular pathway that s engaged by glucose in muscle cells at least initial steps is very similar to what happens in beta cells in pancreas added dr lin who is also professor of cell and developmental biology at university of michigan medical school. its amazing how subtle changes in glucose can be detected throughout body lin said. beta cells respond nerve cells respond and now we know that muscle cells respond directly too. metabolic syndrome has become global epidemic that markedly increases risk for t2 dm cardiovascular disease and non alcoholic steatohepatitis. t2 dm is one of fastest growing diseases in europe with about 60 million people currently afflicted. world health organization who projects diabetes deaths will double between 2005 and 2030. being overweight or obese is important risk factor for diabetes. it is estimated that about 10.3 of men and 9.6 of women aged 25 years and over in european region have condition. impaired muscle insulin action is early hallmark of obesity associated metabolic disorders. skeletal muscle insulin resistance has been associated with reduced mitochondrial oxidative function and shift from oxidative to glycolytic muscle fibre type in patients with t2 dm. engagement of this nutrient sensing pathway results in glucose stimulated akt activation that acts with insulin to promote muscle glucose uptake study concluded. as such muscle specific transgenic activation of this pathway improved postprandial glucose clearance whereas its deficiency impaired insulin action leading to glucose intolerance. nine out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented if people exercised more ate better stopped smoking and adopted other healthy behaviors according to report in thursdays issue of new england journal of medicine. study findings suggest behavior is main culprit in type 2 diabetes also known as adult onset diabetes and that 91 of diabetes cases that appeared among 85.000 female nurses could be attributed to habits and forms of behavior. majority of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented by adoption of healthier lifestyle reported researchers led by dr. frank hu of harvard school of public health in boston massachusetts. type 2 diabetes occurs when body can not properly use blood sugar controlling hormone insulin. obesity is known to be major contributor to condition. hus team wanted to determine extent of role lifestyle plays in type 2 diabetes. using diet and lifestyle questionnaires hus team compared data on 3.300 nurses who developed diabetes over 16-year period with data on those who did not. most important risk factor they found was being overweight. heavier nurse was greater risk. but even having weight at high end of normal range nearly tripled risk hu pointed out. on other hand physical activity showed strong protective effect. women who exercised for 7 or more hours per week were half as likely to develop diabetes than women who exercised for less than half hour weekly researchers found. they noted that same precautions for preventing type 2 diabetes including exercise and weight control also guard against heart disease.,"if you have more lean muscle tissue you have

identify 28.000 medicinal plants that treat ailments from cancer to diabetes alternative before it 's news.,in recent years term plant medicine has come to be associated with psychedelics like mushrooms and ayahuasca which are increasingly documented to provide mental and emotional relief to users. but according to recent analysis from kew gardens in united kingdom there are over 28.000 other plants currently being used as medicine throughout world. second annual report from britains royal botanic gardens at kew located in london is result of research and analysis of 128 scientists from 12 countries around across globe. according to their findings there are 28.187 plants currently recorded as being of medicinal use. in many regions of world people still rely on traditional plant based medicines for their primary healthcare. this is especially true for many rural communities in africa parts of asia and central and south america where plants and knowledge of their traditional use are accessible and affordable. in other countries many of these traditional plant based medicines are being integrated through regulations into mainstream health systems. though plant medicines are making their way into mainstream researchers note that currently just 16 4.478 of species used in plant based medicines are cited in medicinal regulatory publication. even so they note data on drugs approved by fda and similar agencies since 1981 1.130 new therapeutic agents have been approved for use as pharmaceutical drugs of which 593 are based on compounds from natural sources. thirty eight are derived from medicinal plants. fifteen of 56 natural drugs registered for treatment of cancer since 1980 are derived from medicinal plants with long history of traditional use. they note for example that anti cancerous drugs vincristine and vinblastine are derived from madagascar periwinkle catharanthus roseus in apocynaceae family. for example drugs based on paclitaxel have been isolated from yew tree taxus spp. camptothecin from happy tree camptotheca acuminata and podophyllotoxin from may apple podophyllum hexandrum and p. peltatum. further researchers have discovered over 1.000 species of beneficial plants since their survey last year. as yahoo news summarized new plants discovered over past year include nine species of climbing vine used in treatment of parkinsons disease. report said two plants artemisinin and quinine are among most important weapons against malaria which killed over 400.000 people in 2015 yahoo summarized. according to monique simmonds deputy director of science at kew report is highlighting huge potential that there is for plants in areas like diabetes and malaria yahoo reported. one study documents 656 flowering plant species used traditionally for diabetes representing 437 genera and 111 families report explains. it also points out that of only five drugs developed specifically for symptomatic treatment of alzheimers disease two are derived from plants. some particularly powerful species of plants include fabaceae pea and bean lamiaceae mint euphorbiaceae spurge apocynaceae dogbane malvaceae mallow apiaceae parsley or carrot and ranunculaceae buttercup. their key classes of compounds are alkaloids fabaceae terpenes lamiaceae diterpenoids euphorbiaceae cardiac glycosides apocynaceae organic acids malvaceae coumarins apiaceae and alkaloids ranunculaceae. another highly useful plant documented in report is moraceae which is used in treatment of diabetes. though their report offers great promise they highlight some pitfalls. stressing that correct labeling of plant medicines is vital they explain product labeling is frequently misleading with trade name ginseng for example referring to 15 different species of plant each with its own particular chemistry and therapeutic properties[10. substitution by belgian clinic of one chinese medicinal herb fang ji with another sharing same name led to over 100 patients requiring kidney dialysis for remainder of their lives. they also point out threat to plants themselves. increasing demand for herbal medicines particularly for species covered by pharmacopoeias threatens wild populations of many of these plants they note adding that focus of world trade on relatively few species of medicinal plants leads to sustainability and conservation issues which ultimately lead to other plants being substituted with potential risks to human health. they advocate more precise scientific labeling of plants and more clarity on which plants have or have not been studied in drug discovery programmes. such approaches they contend will be hugely important in improving our ability to realise current and future medicinal benefits from plants. as pharmaceutical drugs continue to wreak hazardous consequences healing power of natural plants appears to hold great promise for humans seeking treatment without chemical side effects of current popular medicines.,by carey wedler anti

positive effect in improved glucose metabolism some scientists suggested. green tea is precious drink processed numbers of health benefit known to almost everyone in asia and western world. glucose metabolism is action of body to convert glucose intake to energy for needs of body tissue and organs through oxidized glucose to carbon dioxide and water. stages of abnormal glucose metabolism stretches from mild forms of glucose intolerance pre diabetes to diabetes and finally to pregravid forms of diabetes associated with end organ disease. long term abnormal glucose metabolism is considered as leading cause of diabetes and diabetic complications. some researchers even suggested that abnormalities of glucose metabolism can induce excess body weight and increase potentially modifiable risk factors for cardiac morbidity and mortality. and long term of impaired glucose tolerance igt is considered as marker for state of insulin resistance and prediction of vessel vascular complications independent of patients progression to diabetes. normal blood glucose level tested while fasting of healthy individuals are in range of 3.9 and 5.5 mmol l 70 to 100 mg dl. and no more than 7.8 mmol l 140 mg dl 2 hours after eating. green tea extract in evaluation of carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes in control and streptozotocin high fat diet -induced diabetic rats in 30 days demonstrated significant activity in ameliorated over expression of plasma glucose glycylated hemoglobin hba1c and increase in levels of insulin and hemoglobin. expression of hemoglobin a1c is average level of blood sugar over past 2 to 3 months. normal hemoglobin molecule measured in volume of blood is 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter g dl for men and 12.1 to 15.1 g dl for women. further analysis also found that application exerted profound effect to restore in some extends function of altered activities of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism such as hexokinase pyruvate kinase lactate dehydrogenase in both diabetic and control groups. abnormal over 105 m or 0.9 mg% function of hexokinase in converted glucose into glucose-6-phosphate was associated moderate to severe hypoglycemia. pyruvate kinase is enzyme with function in catalyzed last step of glycolysis. deficiency of pyruvate kinase was associated to risk of metabolic disorder. lactate dehydrogenase ldh or ld is enzyme with function to catalyze conversion of lactate to pyruvic acid and back. in diabetic rats group green tea extract strongly averted abnormal expression of glycogen phosphorylase in liver to near normal levels. additionally diabetic group after administration of green tea extract exhibited antihyperglycemic potential observed through improved muscle and hepatic glycogen content. glycogen phosphorylase is enzyme with function to release sugar from its cells. findings showed that green tea extract has directed implication in attenuated abnormal glucose metabolism in compared to effectiveness of conventional medicine metformin standard oral hypoglycemic drug. moreover in study to confirm epidemiological studies suggestion of improvement of glucose metabolism in diabetic mice researchers found that injection green tea in diabetic mice and streptozotocin induced diabetic mice after 2 6 h expresses lower levels of glucose with no alternation of serum insulin level at dose of 300 mg kg in compared to normal and control mice. in protein differentiation green tea extract administration decreased serum protein level with function in stimulated glucose production and minimized increase of blood glucose levels through stimulating additional small amounts of insulin in diabetes. these results addressed another indication of green tea function in exerted direct influence in modulation of glucose metabolism in tested subjects. interestingly in investigation of green tea effect in glucose uptake inhibitory activity in caco-2 cells scientists also indicated that green tea at temperature of 60 degree in celsius significantly improves capacity of antioxidant in inhibition of glucose uptake through regulation of cell glucose metabolism. incredibly temperature over 60 degree celsius green tea application did not increased or showed up ward trend in inhibitory potential huazhong agricultural university suggested. taken together green tea with abundant bioactive phytochemicals may be considered as function food in improved glucose metabolism in reduced risk of diabetes onset. people in high risk diabetes such as prediabetics may want to add 1 or 2 cups of

diets it 's not just cutting sugar and carbs it 's eating veggies and whole grains. ,natural news healthy diet full of nutritious foods can help prevent different diseases and improve your overall well being. and according to recent study following plant based diet can help lower type 2 diabetes risk. study was conducted by researchers from saw swee hock school of public health sshsph and duke nus medical school in singapore and published in american journal of epidemiology. epidemiological study which is study of how often health conditions occur in different groups of people and why like this can be used to determine some general population wide associations about eating trends that are better for people but they are nt as effective at providing conclusions about which individual food groups suit certain people. researchers noted that these criteria encourage healthy eating principles. but at same time fruits and whole grains have higher amounts of carbohydrate which can increase blood glucose levels. they warned that these types of foods might require more insulin production which can negatively impact individuals who are at risk of type 2 diabetes. for study researchers examined five different dietary patterns that were mainly based on consumption of plant based foods with minimally processed foods and sugar sweetened beverages. related diet for diabetes consume more moringa. researchers gathered health data from over 45.500 middle aged and elderly volunteers who did not have type 2 diabetes between 1993 to 1998. participants were then asked to report their intake of food based on 165 items and they were scored on how this related to one of five dietary patterns. after 11-year follow up researchers discovered that 5.207 volunteers had been diagnosed with diabetes. participants who scored in top 20 percent of high quality dietary patterns had 16 to 29 percent reduction in developing type 2 diabetes unlike those in lowest 20 percent. rob van dam professor from sshsph and senior author of study shared that findings are consistent with research in other populations wherein healthy diet full of minimally processed plant foods e.g. fruit legumes nuts vegetables and whole grains and lower intake of red and processed meat and sugary drinks were significantly associated with lower diabetes. benedict jephcote editor of diabetes.co.uk added that when interpreting study it is necessary to understand context of comparators. overall many studies that show eating greater intake of whole grains and lower intake of red meat as healthier can provide this association because average person in study is not eating healthily. jephcote explained that individuals who consume whole grains usually have lower intakes of refined carbohydrates and sugar. they also tend to be health conscious and live healthier lifestyle which is linked to lower likelihood of smoking and regular exercise. on other hand most people who consume red meat are nt as health conscious. individuals who eat lot of red meat may also have higher than average intakes of alcohol processed foods and sugar. they also tend to smoke more and be less active. if you have diabetes heres list of nutritious foods that you need to add to your diet. berries contain antioxidants that can help prevent oxidative stress which is associated with different health conditions like certain types of cancer and heart disease. oxidative stress occurs when there is imbalance between antioxidants and free radicals unstable molecules in body. research has shown that individuals with diabetes have chronic levels of oxidative stress. blackberries blueberries raspberries and strawberries are all rich in antioxidants and fiber. these berries also contain essential vitamins and minerals like manganese potassium and vitamins c and k. leafy greens are rich in essential vitamins minerals and nutrients. they also have minimal impact on your blood sugar levels. vegetables like kale and spinach are important plant based sources of calcium potassium and vitamin a. these vegetables also contain fiber and protein. experts suggest that people with diabetes should consume more leafy greens because they are full of antioxidants and starch digesting enzymes. whole grains contain high levels of fiber and more nutrients compared to refined white grains. fiber rich diet is important if you have diabetes because fiber helps slow down digestion process. slower absorption of nutrients helps stabilize your blood sugar levels. foods like whole wheat and whole grains are lower on glycemic index gi scale than white bread and rice. latter also has less of impact on your blood sugar levels. include following types of whole grains in your diet if you want to lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes avoid sugary drinks reduce your consumption of red meat and follow healthy diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables.,

disease are either caused by cells in pancreas dying off or receptor sites clogged up by fat and cholesterol. in some cases diabetes is also caused by allergic reaction of cells in immune system. symptoms of type 2 diabetes are characterized by high blood sugar insulin resistance and relative lack of insulin with most common symptoms of increased thirst frequent urination unexplained weight

effects of black carrot and its major phenolic compounds in reduced onset of diabetes researchers at joint analysis lead by indian institute of vegetable research launched investigation of molecular interactions of phenolic compounds of black carrot with enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in compared to standard inhibitors in human. according to vitro assay black carrot purified extract and standard inhibitors acarbose and vildagliptin oral anti hyperglycemic drugs exerted significant activities in inhibition of -amylase -glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4. -amylase amylase is enzyme with function of catalyses hydrolysis of starch into sugars. alpha glucosidase is glucosidase with function in breaking down starch and disaccharides to glucose. and alpha glucosidase inhibitors are conventional oral anti diabetic drugs with function in preventing digestion of carbohydrates in patient with type 2 diabetes. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 dpp4 serine exopeptidase has strong implication to onset of type 2 diabetes with function in regulation of biological activity of hormones and chemokines such as glucagon like peptide-1 incretin hormone nwhich has significant impact in glucose dependent insulin secretion and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide with unique function on insulin and glucagon secretion in humans. at ic50 value purified extract of black carrot demonstrated stronger effect in compared to standard inhibitor acarbose conventional diabetic drug. according to docking scores application of black carrot extract inhibited diabetes through its expression of antioxidant in production of fewer anthocyanin molecules in compared to their respective inhibitors. further analysis of anthocyanin molecules of black carrot cyanidin 3-xylosyl galactoside researchers discovered that black carrot extract displays potential drug activities in inhibited enzymes serine exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase-4(dpp4 similar to those of vildagliptin. dr. karkute sg lead scientist after taking into account of other confounders soad anthocyanins from black carrot were found to be effective to control diabetes and cyaniding 3-xylosyl galactoside

prevent even reverse diabetes type 1 and 2 ).,while it is still not commonly held in mainstream discourse that humanity could survive and even thrive without some form of monetary exchange more and more people that are starting to trace their general discontent about contemporary society to its source are finding money and profit motive at root of it. perhaps first of knee jerk reactions some people might have to idea of shifting into money free system is sinking feeling of watching their hard earned wealth evaporate into nothingness which they might equate with abject poverty. we are so programmed to equate money with abundance that we do nt understand what abundance truly is. at heart of it our net abundance is shared and is grounded in resources available in nature on planet. aggregate of these natural resources not only represents our potential abundance but our very survival. money system grants ownership to many of these resources and makes it exponentially easier for those with abundance to get more abundance at expense of vast majority of people. money system is in some ways antithetical to proper management and distribution of these resources. without money each individual would naturally be entitled to their share of all resources in world and that would never change. but how would such system work. jacque fresco founder of venus project believes that world has reached level of technology that will allow us to build fully self sustaining communities all over world which when optimally designed will provide not only unimaginably high level of abundance for all its residents but far greater sense of shared purpose within community. this vision is grounded in principles of resource based economy without profit motive individuals within community will naturally turn their energy towards efficient maintenance of infrastructure and problem solving and innovation for collective as happiness and well being of community is naturally equated with ones own happiness and well being. in video below is brief introduction to frescos inspiring vision of our potential future. more information. including where venus project is at on their timeline is available on their website. no need for trade since money is nothing more than medium of exchange it is only in removing convention of exchange or trade itself that then renders money obsolete. that s why resource based economy proposes that all resources must be declared as common heritage of all earths inhabitants. in his tedx talk colin turner really questions idea that trade is only organizational model for life on planet and in fact outlines ways in which trade is actually antithetical to human abundance and well being we all more or less accept trade as being de facto way of operating our society so much so that we even see it as some kind of universal law. but it might surprise you to know actually that trade has only existed in relatively recent years that in 90 of our modern human history we did nt actually trade at all there still are no archaeological traces of trade. in these early tribal agrarian communities what actually happened was there was implied understanding that everyone in tribe looked after each other. and this was how tribes operated for perhaps vast majority of our early human history. so we see trade now as very important way of doing business and you have to say that trade works i get what i want and you get what you want and we all go home happy. but when you actually scratch surface little bit more about how trade actually pans out in real world its not such nice story. it seems to be better theory than actually works out in practice. for example most obvious case is about 3 billion people in world today live on 2.50 or less daymany of them much much less than that. obviously they are wracked with starvation or dying of curable diseases so i mean you have to ask yourself is trade really working for them for those people. clearly it is nt. colin turner is founder of free world charter which currently has 58.611 signatories among people from 215 different countries and would welcome yours if you are so inclined. charter constitutes set of principles that really formalizes notion that all human individuals are entitled to maintain equal share of earths resources but it also outlines natural responsibilities and practices that each individual would assume in order to live optimally and harmoniously together in money free community and world. here are ten principles highest concern of humanity is combined common good of all living species and biosphere. life is precious in all its forms and free to flourish in combined common good. earths natural resources are birthright of all its inhabitants and free to share in combined common good. every human being is equal part of worldwide community of humans and free citizen of earth. our community is founded on spirit of cooperation and understanding of nature provided through basic education. our community provides for all its members necessities of healthy fulfilling and sustainable life freely and without obligation. our community respects limits of nature and its resources ensuring minimal consumption and waste. our community derives its solutions and advances progress primarily through application of logic and best available knowledge. our community acknowledges its duty of care and compassion for members who are unable to contribute. our community acknowledges its responsibility to maintain diverse and sustainable biosphere for all future life to enjoy these are certainly not final words on which principles should truly define future society and world free of money but in reading them one can clearly grasp overall essence of kind of mindset we will need to develop and implement in our lives if we are to shift into this new paradigm. shift we are looking for here is grounded in conscious move by individuals of this planet away from model of competition and towards model of cooperation. we are all quite familiar with both as we surely have ample amount of experience in both ways of relating to people around us. if you could choose right now which kind of model would you want as basis for entire planet. some might argue that competitive trade money paradigm has been instrumental in getting us to make progress especially technologically which we may not have achieved by remaining with cooperative tribal model. there may be some truth in this. but does it not seem that at this time in history most of us have had it with debt scarcity and inequality that is hallmark of money model. are we not hungering for more love cooperation and shared abundance imbued in very organizational structures we create for ourselves to live. understand that making this change is not as simple as going to united nations or other authoritative world body as jacque fresco has already done. presenting compelling vision of future without money to benefit of all of humanity does not automatically mean that world authority will implement it right away. powers behind world authority like un are actually made up of those who have most money. what we see going on in public arena are essentially machinations of puppets they control. this is nothing new. overall system that maintains power by few has been in place ever since money and exchange were introduced. while in past this wealth was protected over generations and generations by certain families who were visible royalty noblemen and aristocracy of day todays world only differs in sense that these powers are more hidden from sight while countries maintain illusion of having some form of democracy. point is that we will never be able to elicit help of our authority if we want to abandon our current money economy. those in authority who at very top own vast percentage of worlds resources certainly believe they would have most to lose if we moved to model founded on equally shared abundance. what we actually need to do is elicit help of each other energizing important movements and fostering awakening as to how powerful we actually are as collective. when critical mass of us begin marching in step to new way of life current authority will have no power to stop us. money free society and world can certainly work from standpoint of creating abundance for everyone on planet. what is needed is new awareness founded on some of natural principles discussed here. more that individuals of planet slowly move away from competitive money centered practices and spend their time and energy cultivating cooperation more quickly we will be able to collectively walk away from system that no longer serves us.,leave your drugs in chemists pot

phenomenon health before it 's news. ,in this months prestigious british medical journal lancet has given considerable coverage in its june issue to fact of dangerous upsurge for both young and old of variety of diabetes which is becoming one of largest global health crises of 21st century. lancet is oldest medical journal in world founded in 1823. in short etymology of name of journal was intended to convey excellence in medical research and to provide light of wisdom. once thought of as disease that only affected older people diabetes is now being diagnosed increasingly in people under age of 20 vast implications of which have yet to be fully understood nor appreciated. alarming rising rates have been recorded in first decade of 21st century not only in america and europe but particularly middle east and africa of diabetes which has been shocking to say least. asian countries india and china show similar trends. most influential factor in increase in diabetes in 5 to 15 age group is junk food. more and more young people are developing early stages of diabetes and those that are diagnosed and some even hospitalised due to further complications of disease such as kidney disease and teenagers incredibly having heart attacks costs countrys health system considerably and in addition in terms of lost wages and productivity where adults are concerned. main goal is to reduce rates of hospitalisation and help those diagnosed to better manage their care with simpler smaller insulin delivery systems that take some of inevitable embarrassment and stigma away from disease so improving children and publics knowledge of diabetes is priority. bottom line especially for our children and grandchildren is to limit or eradicate eating junk foods. such so called food is calorie dense and nutrient poor. in recent decades junk food essentially fast food and convenience food consumption in america alone increased dramatically with more than 25 percent of all people now consuming predominantly junk food diets. this trend has occurred concurrently with rising epidemics of numerous chronic diseases and accounts for long list of reasons why eating junk food is bad. it directly contributes to on set of diabetes full stop. also junk food plays major role in obesity epidemic. by year 2050 rate of obesity in america is expected to reach 45 percent according to researchers at harvard university. children who eat fast food as regular part of their diets consume more fat carbohydrates and processed sugar with less fibre than those who do not eat fast food regularly. junk food in these childrens diets accounts for 187 extra calories per day leading to 6 additional pounds of weight gain per year. obesity increases risk of cardiovascular disease diabetes and many other chronic health conditions. such fast foods may be connected to depression and therefore increase in doctors over prescribing opioids dangers of which are now only too well known. in contrast diets that had vegetables whole grains and lactose sugar that comes from milk and other dairy products had protective effects against developing depression. there are increased risks of becoming diabetic for adolescents and young adults due lack of consideration by us parents in overall lifestyle plan we should as responsible adults impose on our children. easy fix of allowing ones child to spend way too much time on their iphones on video games and bingeing on mcdonalds et al. by our accepting that our children live what is in effect sedentary lifestyle is also major contributor to onset of diabetes. in sense advances in technology and new gadgets make children less physically active less sportive than bygone generations and thus natures balance is thrown off because of easy and quick nature of life our acceptance that our child keeps quiet makes our life as parents easier. so we must share bulk of blame for onset of diabetes in children. we consciously allow their addiction to their hand helds whilst also acquiescing to their requests for junk foods from pizzas to burgers usually accompanied by variety of sugary drinks that come almost free with such so called meals. and finally we are helping increase insistence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd in our children which was very recently reiterated in exhaustive study published in journal of clinical psychiatry on may 23 2018. fact is prevalence of variety of different types of diabetes is increasing worldwide. we must take corrective action for future generations before its too late by reintroducing in our family value rules concept of discipline rationing our childrens use of their electronic gadgetry whilst encouraging outside or inside sporting activities particularly team

their victims to engage these junk science recipes that are listed on adas very own website. is there any wonder why nearly 30 million americans are living with diabetes right now. that s about ten percent of total population. most diabetics think that only health concern they have to deal with is their blood sugar level and according to confounded ada its no wonder why. aim of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar levels as normal as possible but what about preventing cancer heart disease alzheimers inflammation hypertension and dehydration. most diseases and disorders are culprits and catapults for other diseases and disorders and diabetes is no exception. in fact diabetes doubles risk of liver pancreas and endometrial cancer and increases risk of breast bladder and colorectal cancer by up to 50 percent. america is home of dangerous food toxins including processed gluten insecticides on conventional fruits nitrates in meats high fructose corn syrup hfcs artificial sweeteners pesticide laden gmos glyphosate weed killer on wheat and soy and artificial hormones in nearly all conventional dairy products and meats. ada focuses nearly entirely on diabetics

type 2 diabetes alternative before it 's news.,if you have type 2 diabetes you already know your blood sugar levels can get too high. your body develops problem called insulin resistance where it does nt use insulin normally. while your pancreas can create insulin to offset issue that only works so well. and while rate of diabetes seems to be levelling off in u.s. this is still very serious issue. 1 if you have type 2 diabetes here are some things you should really know and do. for those living with type 2 diabetes depression is more common than you think. depression is serious issue that can interfere with ability of people to take care of themselves reducing motivation to exercise eat healthy or even take medications. 2 many times these things are crucial to managing disease. that s why mental health coaching can be so important it could not only help with depression but also reduce blood sugar levels. your body and mind will thank you. another easy thing you can do is change your eating habits. recent study suggests eating better over timechoosing more fruits and vegetables or eating whole grains for examplecould reduce your chances for type 2 diabetes by about 20 percent. 3 no idea where to start. here are some diet choices you might like but remember to always talk with your doctor before making any changesespecially if you re taking medication or insulin since diabetes is associated with carbohydrate intolerance low carb diet could be great option for reducing blood sugar and lowering risk for heart disease. 4 some evidence suggests lowering your salt to lower your risk for heart disease by half. 5 unless you re vegan eating more eggs could be great way to lower your risk for type 2 diabetes. 6 adding beneficial herbs like rosemary and oregano to your meals could work in much same way as medications used to control blood sugar. 7 when person already has type 2 diabetes excess sugars and fats in blood make cardiovascular risks higher. while exercise has always been popular common sense prescription one study suggests exercise might be most effective after meal. 8 but its not just adults that can benefit of course. why not take time as family for some after dinner exercise. and kids should also think about putting down those digital distractions too. one study suggests heavy use of electronic media especially watching too much tv and videos was linked to higher levels of cardiovascular and type 2 diabetes risk factors in children. 9 are you facing lots of deadlines at work. workplace stress could even be factor for type 2 diabetes. for first time researchers have found possible connection between two with latest study suggesting people under high stress levels at work are almost 45 percent more likely to develop type 2. 10 looking into meditation can be great help. remember you can make changes in your life to get your type 2 diabetes under control but act now to protect your overall health. one study suggests people with type 2 could perform worse on cognitive tests measuring abilities involved in control of emotions behaviors and thought. 11 another comments women with diabetes may be predisposed to more advanced stage

cancer helps reverse diabetes backed by science. ,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed your sickness. hippocrates fasting has not received as much attention as it should when it comes to world of health and medicine. that s because you ca nt really make any money off of it. pharmaceutical science studies used in medical schools to teach doctors about human health simply do nt focus enough on fasting for doctors to be knowledgable in subject. doctors also learn very little about nutrition and are trained to prescribe drugs as result. dr. jason fung is trying to change all that. toronto based nephrologist he completed medical school and internal medicine at university of toronto before finishing his nephrology fellowship at university of california los angeles at cedars sinai hospital. he joined scarborough general hospital in 2001 where he continues to practice and change peoples lives. he is one of growing number of scientists and doctors to create awareness about tremendous health benefits that can be achieved from fasting. its one of oldest dietary interventions in world and has been practiced for thousands of years. if properly practiced fasting was bad or harmful in any way as some doctors suggest it would have been known by now and studies would not be emerging showing health benefits that can be achieved from fasting regularly. for example recent study published in journal cell shows how fasting diet can trigger pancreas to regenerate itself which works to control blood sugar levels and reverse symptoms of diabetes. mark mattson one of foremost researchers of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying multiple neurodegenerative disorders like parkinsons and alzheimers disease has shown through his work that fasting can have tremendous effect on brain and could prevent or even reverse symptoms of multiple neurodegenerative disorders. you can watch great tedx talk he gave on topic here. scientists have also discovered first evidence of natural intervention triggering stem cell based regeneration of organ or system. study was published in june 5 issue of cell stem cell by researchers from university of southern california. research shows that cycles of prolonged fasting protect against immune system damage and induce immune system regeneration. they concluded that fasting shifts stem cells from dormant state to state of self renewal. source we could not predict that prolonged fasting would have such remarkable effect in promoting stem cell based regeneration of heatopoietic system. when you starve system tries to save energy and one of things it can do to save energy is to recycle lot of immune cells that are not needed especially those that may be damaged. what we started noticing in both our human work and animal work is that white blood cell count goes down with prolonged fasting. then when you re feed blood cells come back. valter longo corresponding author. if we take look at recent study from 2014 published in journal trends in molecular medicine it outlines and confirms what several studies before it have already done caloric restriction diet high in nutrients but low in calories and its mimetics cr improve lifespan and reduce cancer incidence clinical trials with regards to fasting and how it fights cancer are currently underway. interview with fung regarding diabetes dr. fung recently published book co authored with jimmy moore titled complete guide to fasting heal your body through intermittent alternate day and extended fasting its great book that puts to rest fears and myths associated with extended water fasting. he also recently published obesity code unlocking secrets of weight loss fung like 90 percent of doctors out there was conventionally oriented. he is kidney specialist and many of his patients had have type 2 diabetes as result of that. it eventually became clear to him that something was very wrong with conventional treatment of type 2 diabetes. with type 2 diabetes patients who take insulin and follow recommended dietary guidelines would still have several complications mainly kidney disease. because of this they can go blind require dialysis or even require amputations. in interview below with dr. joseph mercola dr. fung addresses multiple myths and issues that are commonly brought up about fasting. and dives into explaining how fasting does not burn muscle how it can reverse diabetes addresses starvation mode myth explains role of insulin discusses different variations of fasting and much more. be sure to visit his website where you can find information on him his practice results lectures and article that he continually publishes every month. humans live on one quarter of what they eat on other three quarters lives their doctor. egyptian pyramid inscription recommendation for beginners something we put in most of our fasting articles one recommended way of doing it which was tested by bbcs michael mosley in order to reverse his diabetes high cholesterol and other problems associated with his obesity is what is known as 5:2 diet. on 5:2 plan you cut your food down to one fourth of your normal daily calories on fasting days about 600 calories for men and about 500 for women while consuming plenty of water and tea. on other five days of week you can eat normally. another way to do it as mentioned above is to restrict your food intake between hours of 12 pm and 7 pm daily while not eating during hours outside of that time. its good to see more and more people becoming more conscious about our planet and what is happening on it its great to see more people take active role in doing some independent research and critical thinking. disease rates are skyrocketing and have been for quite some time. large portion of this can be attributed to our eating habits and all of toxic and harmful substances we put into our bodies regularly. over past few years food industry has been exposed in several ways whether its issues concerning gmos and pesticides that go with them or all of examples of pharmaceutical fraud. all of it is result of massive shift in consciousness that s happening on our planet where so much is coming to light in all aspects of our every day lives food and health is just one. fasting is also sparking interest of many because along with this consciousness shift comes awareness of world beyond our physical one. this realm deals with near death experiences quantum physics parapsychology and our overall spiritual nature and proof that s emerging that we are more than just this body and that human beings do indeed have spiritual nature. fact that modern day science in many instances is catching up to ancient wisdom is quite exciting. not only in neuroscience and quantum physics but health as well.,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed.

through disturbing gut flora alternative before it 's news. ,while it is not commonly understood concept that wheat or gluten can cause blood sugar disorders and certainly not as serious as type 1 diabetes which involves autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells in pancreas sizable body of animal and human data points to exactly this causal link. i gluten after all is well known for adversely affecting gut health and in case of celiac disease destroying absorptive surface of intestine through hallmark autoimmune triggered process. in many ways gluten opens up pandoras box of autoimmunity by both triggering intestinal permeability so called leaky gut as well as providing over 23.000 unique digestion resistant polypeptides which are capable of infiltrating body causing systemic inflammation and loss of immunological self tolerance i.e. ability to distinguish self from non self. adding to this increasingly dismal picture of what was once considered ultimate poster child for healthy food new study published in plos one may have uncovered missing link in understanding how wheat exerts its toxic effects. mayo clinic researchers sought to elucidate mechanism at play within long observed link in both animal and human studies between dietary gluten and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes t1d focusing on role of gut microflora in mediating its diabetes promoting properties. in new study titled low incidence of spontaneous type 1 diabetes in non obese diabetic mice raised on gluten free diets is associated with changes in intestinal microbiome.[ii they sought to confirm whether changes in intestinal microbiome could be attributed to pro- and anti diabetogenic effects of gluten containing and gluten free diets respectively. they noted recent research showing that intestinal microflora have major influence on incidence of t1d and theorized that since diet is known to shape composition of intestinal microbiome they might find important link by testing changes in gut flora of animals fed either gluten or gluten free diets. study design was described as follows researchers observed following results first of all gcc fed gluten containing chow fed nod mice had expected high incidence of hyperglycemia elevated blood sugar whereas nod mice fed with gfc gluten free chows had significantly reduced incidence of hyperglycemia. secondly when fecal microbiomes were compared bifidobacterium tannerella and barnesiella species were increased p 0.03 0.02 and 0.02 respectively in microbiome of gcc gluten containing chow fed mice where as akkermansia species was increased p 0.02 in intestinal microbiomes of nod non obese diabetic mice fed gfc gluten free chows. thirdly both of gluten free chows that were evaluated either egg white based ew gfc or casein based c gfc significantly reduced incidence of hyperglycemia. researchers found that when they added back gluten to gluten free diet group following occurred according to study these observed changes suggest that presence of gluten is directly responsible for pro diabetogenic effects of diets and it determines gut microflora. they observed gluten free diabetes inhibitory diet resulted in altering non obese diabetic mices microflora to reflect richer bacterial profile. conversely they observed that gluten containing diet resulted decreases in genus of gastrointestinal microbiotia akkermansia previously shown to protect against development of type 1 diabetes. since immune system develops and its function is maintained in large part through its relationship with microflora in our gut it makes sense that glutens promotion of autoimmune disorders which include celiac disease and type 1 diabetes to name but few could be connected to way this complex of proteins adversely affects diversity of gastrointestinal microflora. researchers concluded our novel study thus suggests that dietary gluten could modulate incidence of t1d type 1 diabetes by changing gut microbiome. this new study follows closely in wake of another recent plos study that found alcohol soluble portion of gluten known as gliadin promotes weight gain and pancreatic beta cell hyperactivity potential contributor to type 2 diabetes marked by excessive and/or elevated insulin and precursor to type 1 diabetes. given increasingly dense body of research indicating wheat has diabetogenic properties time has come to recognize that many of most common ailments that afflict our species today are direct result of consumption of popular foods such as wheat which are mistakenly believed to be safe and wholesome. to learn more about wheats 200 adverse health effects visit our wheat and gluten research section. ii eric v marietta andres m gomez carl yeoman ashenafi y tilahun chad r clark david h

dirty electricity cause type 3 diabetes. video alternative before it 's news.,diabetes according to former fda toxicologist dr dana flavin md phd has increased 700 percent over years. as of 2014 cdc stated that 9.3 percent of u.s. population had diabetes 21 million diagnosed and 8.1 million undiagnosed. 1 diabetes usually is diagnosed as type 1 or type 2 but according to dr magda havas phd there is third type of diabetes that needs to become mainstreamed information. it results from exposure to electromagnetic frequencies. dr havas ought to know what she s talking about since she works at centre for health studies and environmental resource studies trent university petersborough on canada. 2 in this 7 minute video dr havas explains three types of diabetes type 1 childhood diabetes usually is genetic and affects 5 to 10 percent of diabetics. type 2 adult onset diabetes usually results from lifestyle issues and affects 90 to 95 percent of diabetics. type 3 environment diabetes which is caused by dirty electricity emitted by microwave emfs including those from ami smart meters retrofitted as replacements for emf free analog meters. people who use electronic tread mills which generate dirty electricity have blood sugar levels impacted by those emfs proven by testing. if you use tread mill maybe you ought to check out what s coming off of it in way of emfs by using electrosmog type hand held meter 4. furthermore dr havas suggests that tread mill could become accepted medical test for diagnosing type 3 diabetes. in 2008 dr havas published paper dirty electricity elevates blood sugar among electrically sensitive diabetics and may explain brittle diabetes 3. in abstract of that paper we find what s brittle diabetes you may be wondering. brittle diabetes is sub type of type 1 diabetes. brittle diabetes mellitus or labile diabetes is term used to describe particularly hard to control type 1 diabetes. those people who have brittle diabetes will experience frequent extreme swings in blood glucose levels causing hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 5 above is very important information for any diabetic or pre diabetic to know since they can be affected by electromagnetics and not realize why they ca nt balance their blood sugar. reducing rf emf exposure could change amount of insulin taken too. another way to see how human blood responds to being exposed to electromagnetic frequencies e.g. computers other emf emitting devicescell phones iphones laptops wi fi smart tvs plus inside home wall electric wiring carrying dirty electricity from ami smart meters freshly drawn emf impacted blood can be examined under microscope to see blood cell morphology. if rouleaux clumping stacking or aggregation of blood cells occurs that s indication of electromagnetic stress which can impact blood sugar levels. rouleaux can restrict blood flow in entire body causing loss of oxygen to cells. certain antibiotics also can cause clumping as allergic reaction. to understand what goes on with rouleaux and electrosmog exposure heres short video live blood analysis and electrosmog dr havas produced in august 2009. additionally i d like to suggest that rouleaux formation on live blood analysis also may be effective medical test to confirm ehselectromagnetic hypersensitivity something more and more people are finding affects them. since we live in microwave induced electromagnetic soup we ca nt escape from cell and mast towers horrific wi fiespecially in schools where kids are exposed for hours monitoring devices cell phones all sorts of smart devices and appliances that emit rfs emfs and especially utility companies ami smart meters which transmit dirty electricity 24/7/365 we really need to assess biological fact that we are living in what amounts to operating microwave oven like atmosphere. there are tremendously negative health consequences to our love affair with smart technology we really have nt realized yet. when we do we will realize too late how dumb we were to buy into all these tracking and surveillance devicesas that s what smart is all about so big brother knows what we dobut it may be too late. our brains will have been fried. i hope i m wrong. heres another thought in closing what impact do all these emfs have on human emotions and our brain activity. can they be programming some of irrational behavior we experience as society. just thought. 1 http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics/2014statisticsreport.html 2 www.magdahavas.com 3 dirty electricity elevates blood sugar among electrically sensitive

diabetes from various fronts. some yoga poses like sirsasana pranayama and meditation directly works upon pituitary glands and instruct master glands to work in cohesion with pancreas. there are yoga asanas which controls smooth flow of blood. some yoga poses like ardha matsyendrasana bhujangasana dhanurasana and mayurasana directly work for better health of pancreas. sirsasana is one of best yoga poses to manage and control both type 1 type 2 diabetes. in fact it is single yoga poses which have ability to control not only diabetes but also all hormonal related problems in body. headstand pose enhances blood flow towards head region and stimulates pituitary gland master endocrine gland to control all hormonal changes in body. secretion of too much diabetogenic hormone due to master gland leads to type 2 diabetes. it stimulates islet beta cells of pancreas to secrete appropriate quantity of insulin to maintain optimum level of glucose in body. to get best benefits of this asana knowing its steps is important. ardha matsyendrasana alternately compressed and stretched organs including pancreas. compression being partly applied by pressure of thigh against abdomen. this gives body good massage recirculates impure blood and tones up pancreas and its associated cells. cells especially beta one gets activated and helps in glycogen conversion from glucose. how to do half spinal twist yoga pose is important as is following its steps. bhujangasana stimulates and massages pancreas thus helps in proper functioning of gland. cobra poses and its variations allow more blood to circulate in body region including pancreas. increased amount of blood flow makes organ healthy and enhances its vitality which further helps in efficiency of beta cells. learn simple steps of how to perform cobra pose. bow pose is toned up pancreas and stimulates this endocrine gland to secrete correct amount of glucagon and insulin at right time. this process helps to proper glucose metabolism thus maintain required sugar levels in blood. there are detailed steps for this technique. peacock pose is quite useful in controlling and management of sugar in blood. this advanced yoga asana directly stimulates metabolic process and give diabetic person relief. how to do mayurasana different simple steps of mayurasana are given below sit in vajrasana. open knees and come to kneeling position by placing knees on floor. bend forward stretch out fingers of your hands and place palms on ground. bend elbows keeping forearms together. place elbows gently on either side of navel with chest resting

with legs stretched out and feet together. come back by lowering head place knees on floor and then legs on ground. surya namaskar sun salutation harmonizes pancreas helping to remove any irregularities by directly massaging gland and improving its blood flow. imbalance of it is may be caused by tension and stress. surya namaskar can help to remove deeper cause of hormonal malfunction if it is supplemented by other yoga practices. uddiyan bandha pulls abdominal organs inside and upward position which creates upward flow of prana. uddiyan bandha is good for overall functions of hormonal glands. it improves blood circulation in trunk and strengthens all internal organs. all abdominal organs are toned massaged and strengthened thus helpful in curing of diabetes digestion constipation indigestion etc. place both palms on knees. exhale completely through mouth as well as nose. pull abdominal muscles up and inside towards spine. retain breath outside as long as one can do. inhale slowly and release abdominal muscles and return to normal position. kapalbhati kind of breathing exercise is known as frontal brain cleansing process. powerful breathing yogic practice has power to rejuvenate skull including hypothalamus and pituitary gland. it invigorates entire brain and awakens dormant centers in brain. forced and prolonged exhalation in kapalbhati increases decompression of fluid and expansion of brain and enhances massaging effect on brain. it stimulates nerves in abdominal region massages abdominal organs including pancreas thus overall show good impact in management of diabetes. how to do kapalbhati inhale deeply through both nostrils expanding abdomen and exhale with forceful contraction of abdominal muscles. since now inhalation is passive and without effort. breathing must be of bellows type. while doing this exercise abdomen should distend and contract. pranayama regulates functioning of endocrine glands. pranayama when performed with bandhas they regulate functioning of these glands. pranayama rejuvenates pituitary and pineal glands especially. it activates and invigorates liver spleen pancreas and abdominal muscles and improves digestion. all pranayamas directly or indirectly control functions of endocrine glands particularly pituitary gland. however two pranayamas especially bhastrika and anulom vilom are very very important in managing sugar in blood. bhastrika pranayama bellows pranayama improves digestion and helps to enhance overall function of body. meditation aids overall in lessening signs and symptoms of

mathematical modeling to discover connection between water fluoridation and rise in diabetes in united states between 2005 and 2010. study community water fluoridation predicts increase in age adjusted incidence and prevalence of diabetes in 22 states from 2005 and 2010 was published in journal of water and health in late may. study investigated hypothesis that added water fluoridation has contributed to diabetes incidence and prevalence in united states. kyle fluegge author of paper concluded that community water fluoridation is associated with epidemiological outcomes for diabetes.

glucose. type 2 diabetes is growing epidemic in country with incidence rates quadrupling in past 32 years. in study sole author of paper kyle fluegge used mathematical models to analyze publicly available data on fluoride water levels and diabetes incidence. models look at outcomes of diabetes incidence and prevalence being predicted by both natural and added fluoride said fluegge who performed study as post doctoral fellow in department of epidemiology and biostatistics at ohios case western reserve university school of medicine. when examining diabetes rates across 22 states study found one milligram increase in average county fluoride levels predicted 0.17 percent increase in age adjusted diabetes prevalence. study suggests that adding fluoride additives to water was significantly associated with increases in diabetes between 2005 and 2010. interestingly link to diabetes was different depending on type of fluoride additive used. substances known by name fluoride which are added to municipal water supplies are actually combination of unpurified by products of phosphate mining namely hydrofluorosilicic acid sodium fluorosilicate and sodium fluoride. when sodium fluoride and sodium fluorosilicate were used increase in diabetes was observed. however fluorosilicic acid was associated with decreases in diabetes. counties that do not add fluoride products but instead rely only on naturally occurring calcium fluoride also maintained lower diabetes rates. fluegge observed positive link when he adjusted fluoride exposure levels to account for estimated amount of tap water consumption per individual. fluegge says he does not believe study should change water fluoridation policies just yet but that this should be wake up call for more research on association between water fluoridation and diabetes. this is ecological study. this means it is not appropriate to apply these findings directly to individuals stated fluegge. these are population level associations being made in context of exploratory inquiry. and water is not only direct source of fluoride there are many other food sources produced with fluoridated water.the models present interesting conclusion that association of water fluoridation to diabetes outcomes depends on adjusted per capita consumption of tap water fluegge said. only using concentration of added fluoride does not produce similarly robust consistent association. this was reason why fluegge adjusted his calculations to incorporate tap water consumption rather than choosing calculations that relied on parts per million measurements of fluoride in water. fluegge is correct that average person comes into contact with fluoride products through showers canned goods pesticides processed foods and fluoridated toothpaste. in united states process of purposefully lacing water with fluoride additives began in 1940s. every year thousands of tons of fluorosilicic acid is recovered from phosphoric acid plants and then used for water fluoridation. during this process fluoride ion is created. this process of taking waste from phosphate industry and putting it into drinking water has long been criticized for its effects on human health and that of environment. it is well known that water fluoridation has led to dental fluorosis for millions of children. this discoloring of teeth was called cosmetically objectionable by centers for disease control. beyond cosmetic effect there have been number of studies indicating health issues ranging from arthritis brain problems reduced thyroid or overactive thyroid kidney problems and bone cancers. while proponents of water fluoridation have long pointed to apparent drop in tooth decay in fluoridated nations as proof of its validity those claims have been proven wrong by world health organization. center for disease control and prevention has stated fluoride in water is directly related to better teeth quality however who released its own study showing that tooth decay rates have dropped in all western nations whether fluoridated or not. in 2015 truth in media reported that cochrane collaboration global independent network of researchers professionals and patients reviewed most comprehensive well designed and reliable papers on fluoride before analyzing and publishing their conclusion. trevor sheldon dean of hull york medical school in united kingdom conducted review of water fluoridation in 2000. sheldon concluded that process is not effective. i had assumed because of everything i d heard that water fluoridation reduces cavities but i was completely amazed by lack of evidence he told newsweek. my prior view was completely reversed. sheldon points out that some studies have actually shown that when water fluoridation was ceased cavities went down small percentage among schoolchildren. this includes 2001 study of two british columbia communities that was included in cochrane review. cochrane team also found that most studies confirming effectiveness of fluoridation were completed prior to widespread use of dental products such as mouth rinses and toothpastes. study did find evidence that fluoridation was linked to 26 percent decrease in cavities. however this study was also done before growth of modern dentistry. researchers write we have limited confidence in size of this effect due to high risk of bias within studies and lack of contemporary evidence. in early june 2015 health research board hrb also released in depth review of effects of water fluoridation. review was conducted at behest of u.s. department of health. after examining all internationally peer reviewed papers on topic of fluoride and health effects from 2006 to 2014 hrb found no definitive evidence that community water fluoridation is associated with positive or negative systemic health effects. in february 2015 anti media reported on study published in bmjs journal of epidemiology and community health which confirmed fluorides negative effect on thyroid gland and possible connection to depression weight gain and other negative health effects. researchers with university of kent in england examined thyroid activity for those in areas with fluoridated water and those without. team examined 95 percent of english population in 2012 and 2013 and found high rates of underactive thyroid were 30 more likely in areas with high fluoride concentration. underactive thyroid can lead to depression weight gain fatigue and aching muscles. while study confirms previous studies that showed fluoride interferes with production of iodine for thyroid some experts believe study is not conclusive. prof david coggon professor of occupational and environmental medicine university of southampton believed observations could have been caused by some other variable. it is quite possible that observed association is consequence of other ways in which areas with higher fluoride differ from rest of country he told telegraph. there are substantially more rigorous epidemiological methods by which research team could have tested their idea. beyond health effects themselves there seems to be growing conflict of interest between american health agencies and publicly available data on dangers associated with fluoride. in 2014 truth in media reported over 2000 pages of emails released under freedom of information act request have uncovered apparent conflict of interest between center for disease control and prevention cdc and american dental association ada regarding water fluoridation. emails also contain admission by cdc that those with kidney issues will likely be adversely affected by substance. from september 5th to 8th fluoride action network held 5th citizens conference on fluoride in washington d.c. at conference dan stockin mph released emails and declared that these documents make it abundantly clear .. ada and cdc oral health division are tweedledum and tweedledee of fluoridation promotion. they work hand in hand often at taxpayers expense to spin message in favor of fluoridation. 2500 pages contained emails from 2011 between employees at oral health division of cdc only division at cdc that deals with fluoridation and ada as well as communications from department of health and human services hhs. nidel lawfirm helped in efforts to get emails released. statement from nidel states that these documents raise questions about objectivity of individuals within these agencies and indicate need to get to true motivations behind lack of objectivity in these organizations. natural and non toxic products. up to 50 off every day ad reasons for opposing water fluoridation include fear of variety of health concerns belief that practice is force medicating population without their approval financial waste and environmental concerns related to phosphate mines where chemical is found. what are your thoughts. should american people have choice whether or

need for prescription drugs can be eliminated naturally. while acknowledging that some patients require insulin to manage disease morstein points out that conventional medicines tendency to prescribe multiple anti diabetic medications oral hypoglycemic drugs insulin and ace inhibitors can lead to downward spiral of more and more drugs. once patient is on one oral hypoglycemic agent within three or so years they need second and then within three or so years they need to be on insulin morstein says. in some instances morstein sharply disagrees with standard treatments for diabetes. for instance diet recommended by american diabetes association is terrible and too high in carbs morstein reports. instead she favors very low carb grain free diet to manage diabetes. morstein also states that exercise particularly anaerobic exercise such as resistance training is imperative and maintains that this type of activity uses 19 times as much glucose as walking or running on treadmill. exercise she adds is four times more effective than statin drugs when it comes lowering heart disease risk for diabetics. she also advises regimen of supplements that include vitamins fish oils antioxidants and selected herbs which she calls magnificent at reducing blood sugar and curbing appetite. to learn more about dr. morstein and her natural protocol for treating diabetes do nt miss next

sylvestre plant has been prized in natural medicine since sixth century bc. extracts from leaves have proven so effective in controlling diabetes that ancient indian healing system of ayurveda refers to herb as destroyer of sugar. gymnema sylvestre lowers both blood sugar and hemoglobin a1c while reducing cravings for carbohydrates. amazingly studies show that it also causes regeneration of beta cells cells in pancreas that produce insulin. in one very promising clinical trial people with type 2 diabetes who were taking oral diabetes medication were also given 400 mg of gymnema sylvestre extract day. researchers found that herb caused significant reductions in blood sugar hemoglobin a1c and glycosolated plasma protein levels. after 18-month study patients were able to reduce their dosages of their prescription diabetes medications. in fact several were even able to successfully maintain normal blood glucose levels with herb alone showing that it does indeed help regenerate beta cells. in another year long study 400 mg of gymnema sylvestre day reduced blood sugar levels and insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes. without doubt naturopathic physicians such as

shows this one plant can kill cancer cells treat diabetes blogging citizen journalism before it 's news. ,bitter melon is fruit that grows abundantly in asia africa and caribbean. traditionally it has been used to treat diabetes and other more mild diseases or illnesses. more recently bitter melon juice was shown to kill pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice in study done by university of colorado. considering results were seen in both in vitro and in vivo tests effectiveness of bitter melon juice in treating pancreatic cancer and potentially other cancers at clinical level are promising.[1 ihc analyses of miapaca-2 xenografts showed that bmj(bitter melon juice also inhibits proliferation induces apoptosis and activates ampk adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase in vivo. overall bmj exerts strong anticancer efficacy against human pancreatic carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo suggesting its clinical usefulness. pancreatic cancer is one of most difficult cancers to treat due to fact that it is often discovered late leaving very little time to treat. since traditional therapies chemotherapy radiation surgery etc were not showing promising results and littler advancement was being made researchers have been looking elsewhere to find treatment. interestingly cannabis specifically cannabinoids have been shown to induce apoptic programmed death of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and stop pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.[4 cannabis is perhaps one of most popular treatments being aggressively pursued right now given its promising results both in labs and anecdotally. many cancerous tumors have insulin receptors which move glucose to cancer cells helping them to grow and divide. studies have shown that insulin encourages pancreatic cancer cells to grow in dose dependant manner since bitter melon has been shown to help regulate insulin levels this could help prevent pancreatic cancer over long term. colorado university study was led by dr. rajesh agarwal. they examined effects of bitter melon on 4 different lines of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice. for in vivo studies mice were injected with pancreatic tumor cells and were randomly divided into one of two groups. one group of mice received water which was control group and other group was given bitter melon juice for six weeks. researchers studied tumors at end of study and results showed that bitter melon juice not only inhibited cancer cell proliferation but also induced apoptosis programmed cell death. compared to control tumor growth was inhibited by 60 in treatment group and there were no signs of toxicity or negative effects on body. with toxicity and negative effects being huge role in traditional mainstream treatments this was positive to see. number of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate efficacy of bitter melon for treating diabetes. since it is believed that diabetes is precursor for pancreatic cancer researchers felt bitter melon could treat diabetes as well after seeing pancreatic cancer results. in 2011 results of four week long clinical trial were published in journal of ethnopharmacology that showed modest hypoglycemic effects and significant fructosamine management for those taking 2000mg day of bitter melon. as published by study bitter melon had modest hypoglycemic effect and significantly reduced fructosamine levels from baseline among patients with type 2 diabetes who received 2.000 mg day. however hypoglycemic effect of bitter melon was less than metformin 1.000 mg day.[3 another study published in 2008 in international journal chemistry and biology indicated that compounds in bitter melon improved glycemic control helped cells uptake glucose and improved overall glucose tolerance. this study was done in mice and led to promising advancements in treating diabetes and obesity with bitter melon.[4 in contrast study published in journal of clinical epidemiology in 2007 did not show significant benefit of treatment of diabetes by bitter melon but 2 years later in british journal of nutrition it was stated that more better designed and clinical trials are required to confirm fruits role in diabetes treatment. since that 2007 study more studies have been done to show beneficial effects which perhaps was result of better design. when it comes to bitter melon juice current research available is showing strong results for specific types of cancer cell destruction diabetes treatment and potential prevention of pancreatic cancer. further research and clinical trials would be helpful to better understand how effective this plant can be and in what specific cases. it remains very promising option that could be explored under correct supervision. other uses of bitter melon bitter melon has been used as traditional medicine for long time. it has been used to treat colic fever burns chronic cough painful menstruation and skin conditions.[5.,bitter melon is fruit

it 's news.,ginger has been studied to have value in over 150 health conditions with type 2 diabetes top on list. with anti diabetic drugs linked to increased cardiovascular mortality natural alternatives are needed now more than ever. while ginger is widely used as spice today its role as healing agent is often overlooked in modern society despite its thousands of years of documented use as powerful medicine. modern science however is finally catching up to wisdom of ancients. for instance there are over 2100 published studies on medicinal properties of ginger in scientific literature and greenmedinfo.com database contains evidence that it has value in over 170 different health conditions and has over 50 different beneficial physiological effects. notably of all conditions research on ginger we have indexed reveals its therapeutic value for type 2 diabetes is top on list with seven studies on our database providing proof of its efficacy. and research keeps coming type 2 diabetes is metabolic disorder dominated by high blood sugar hyperglycemia but with inflammation and oxidative stress driving damage most directly linked to morbidity and mortality associated with condition. it is our belief that this condition is driven primarily through combination of evolutionarily incompatible western diet inactivity gut dysbiosis and multiple cumulative chemical exposures and yet rarely do physicians know how or care to address these root causes and reverse them opting for pharmaceutical intervention and fatalistic attitude that serves no ones best interest. it is estimated that half billion people will be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes globally within next two decades. primary conventional treatment approaches using oral anti diabetics and synthetic gmo insulin actually increase risk of death making it of vital importance to find safer more effective alternatives. new study published in journal complementary and integrative medicine effect of ginger zingiber officinale on glycemic markers in patients with type 2 diabetes confirms that ginger is serious contender for addressing some of root causes underlying this devastating condition. iranian researchers conducted double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial on 2060 -year old patients with type 2 diabetes who were on oral anti diabetic drugs but not on insulin. participants in intervention and control groups received 3.000 mgs of powdered ginger or placebo lactose in capsules daily for 3 months. blood sugar glycemic indices markers of oxidative stress tac mda serum paraoxonase hba1c and inflammation crp dietary intake and physical activity were measured at beginning and end of study and after 12 h fasting. comparison of indices after 3 months showed ginger intervention group improved in following eight ways hba1c percentage marker of glucose oxidative stress mediated amage to red blood cells dropped significantly 0.77 0.88 vs 0.02 0.16 p this study is actually almost identical in its findings to one we reported on last year in article titled modest dose of ginger improves 8 markers of diabetes type 2 where even smaller dose of ginger 1600 mg also administered for 3 months resulted in significant reductions in following parameters hba1c aka glycated hemoglobin measurement of how much damage is being caused by sugars to red blood cells in body reflective of body wide damage caused by chronically elevated blood sugar homa homeostatic model assessment which measures insulin resistance and beta cell function pancreatic cells that produce insulin clearly ginger provides wide range of side benefits beyond simply lowering blood sugar. oxidative stress inflammation chronically elevated levels of insulin and/or resistance to it all contribute to primary cause of morbidity and mortality associated with condition cardiovascular disease. whereas conventional drug treatment for type 2 diabetes focuses on lowering blood sugar and hba1c even though both oral antidiabetic drugs and insulin appear to raise risk of heart attack ginger appears to do reduce blood sugar and cardiovascular disease risk effectively freeing two birds with one hand. while amazing ginger is not only natural remedy for type 2 diabetes that has compelling research to support it. you can peruse our type 2 diabetes database and you ll find over 180 natural substances that have been studied to have potential value in condition. you ll also see research there on therapeutic activities like exercise and problem substances like fructose and pesticides that contribute to condition. we should note that if there is one substance that holds greatest promise even beyond ginger it is turmeric. this ancient indian spice appears to prevent and perhaps even reverse some of damage associated with type 2 diabetes and has been found to have potential therapeutic value in staggering 600 plus health conditions. you can read following research

according to dr. morstein vast majority up to 95 percent of diabetics suffer from type 2 diabetes which is triggered primarily by overweight physical inactivity and sugar rich diet. type 1 diabetes on other hand is autoimmune disorder in which immune system attacks pancreas destroying cells that produce insulin. morstein maintains that type 2 diabetes should be treated naturopathically and in many cases need for prescription drugs can be eliminated naturally. while acknowledging that some patients require insulin to manage disease morstein points out that conventional medicines tendency to prescribe multiple anti diabetic medications oral hypoglycemic drugs insulin and ace inhibitors can lead to downward spiral of more and more drugs. once patient is on one oral hypoglycemic agent within three or so years they need second and then within three or so years they need to be on insulin morstein says. in some instances morstein sharply disagrees with standard treatments for diabetes. for instance diet recommended by american diabetes association is terrible and too high in carbs morstein reports. instead she favors very low carb grain free diet to manage diabetes. morstein also states that exercise particularly anaerobic exercise such as resistance training is imperative and maintains that this type of activity uses 19 times as much glucose as walking or running on treadmill. exercise she adds is four times more effective than statin drugs when it comes lowering heart disease risk for diabetics. she also advises regimen of supplements that include vitamins fish oils antioxidants and selected herbs which she calls magnificent at reducing blood sugar and curbing appetite. to learn more about dr. morstein and her natural protocol for treating

prized in natural medicine since sixth century bc. extracts from leaves have proven so effective in controlling diabetes that ancient indian healing system of ayurveda refers to herb as destroyer of sugar. gymnema sylvestre lowers both blood sugar and hemoglobin a1c while reducing cravings for carbohydrates. amazingly studies show that it also causes regeneration of beta cells cells in pancreas that produce insulin. in one very promising clinical trial people with type 2 diabetes who were taking oral diabetes medication were also given 400 mg of gymnema sylvestre extract day. researchers found that herb caused significant reductions in blood sugar hemoglobin a1c and glycosolated plasma protein levels. after 18-month study patients were able to reduce their dosages of their prescription diabetes medications. in fact several were even able to successfully maintain normal blood glucose levels with herb alone showing that it does indeed help regenerate beta cells. in another year long study 400 mg of gymnema sylvestre day reduced blood sugar levels and insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes. without doubt naturopathic physicians such as dr. morstein

now linked to diabetes lowered iq still drinking it. alternative before it 's news. ,fluoridated water now linked to diabetes lowered iq still drinking it. of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. in video above you can watch professor paul connett ph.d. director of fluoride action network fan debate professor mike berridge ph.d. of malaghan institute of medical research in new zealand on topic of water fluoridation. this debate was 12 years in making its taken that long to find someone willing to debate connett and defend controversial practice of water fluoridation. its pressing issue in u.s. as well as in new zealand one of few countries in world where water fluoridation is still practiced. at present only about 52 percent of new zealands population receives fluoridated water but proposed legislation could change this and essentially require mandatory water fluoridation for all of new zealand.1 in order to support this introduction of mandatory water fluoridation new zealand ministry of health recently called on expert panel to review data surrounding water fluoridation and panel not surprisingly concluded it is safe. however information provided by connett in debate should easily undermine fluoridation mandate as practice has been linked to number of health harms including lowered iq. in 2014 lancet neurology released study authored by harvard doctor among others that classified fluoride as developmental neurotoxin.2 it was nt first time. in 2012 meta analysis also by harvard researchers clearly showed that children exposed to fluoride in drinking water had lower iq by average of seven points in areas with raised concentrations.3 this study was used by new zealand fluoride panel to support fluoride safety because researchers mistakenly said meta analysis found average lowering of iq was less than one point. even after they corrected their mistake they did not make it clear that correction meant fluoride was harmful to childrens neurodevelopment. according to fan:4 another issue with panels expert report had to do with their reliance on 2015 study that found no iq difference between fluoridated and non fluoridated community.5 this study was also cited by berridge in support of fluoridation in video above. however here too is case of flawed review intentional or otherwise. as fan reported study had virtually no controls. it compared fluoridated community of 900 children with non fluoridated community of less than 90 about half of which took fluoride supplements. so there was no way to accurately gauge any fluoride related iq differences. panel focused only on aforementioned harvard meta analysis and this flawed iq study completely ignoring more than 300 animal and human studies previously published that point to fluorides role as neurotoxin.6 new study looks into fluoride diabetes connection more than 9 percent of u.s. population suffers from diabetes more than quarter of which remain undiagnosed.7 diabetes rates have nearly quadrupled over last three decades and they continue to rise. while dietary factors and inactivity certainly play role in u.s. diabetes epidemic research conducted by kyle fluegge ph.d. health economist for new york citys health department who completed research as post doctoral fellow at case western reserve university in cleveland ohio tested hypothesis that water fluoridation may be involved. fluegges study used mathematical models to analyze data on fluoride levels in water and rates of diabetes in 22 u.s. states.8 data revealed 1 milligram mg increase in added fluoride was associated with 0.17 percent increase in age adjusted diabetes prevalence even after adjusting for other diabetes risk factors like obesity and physical inactivity. there were also differences noted depending on which type of fluoride was found in water. sodium fluoride was first of fluoride waste materials to be used for fluoridation but now it is rarely used. its most well known as this is compound used as pharmaceutical grade in toxicology studies and other research into potential health dangers of fluoride. in recent study sodium fluoride was linked to increased risk of diabetes as was sodium fluorosilicate. is arsenic contamination in fluoride to blame. for reasons that are unclear another fluoride type fluorosilicic acid was associated with decreases in diabetes as was naturally occurring fluoride. as noted by fluoride action network fan each of these fluoride varieties is byproduct of fertilizer industry and subject to contamination with arsenic.9 although this is speculative its worth noting that chronic arsenic exposure may be linked to increased risk of diabetes.10 fan continued:11 african american and mexican american children have significantly higher rates of dental fluorosis and many low income urban communities also have severe oral health crises despite decades of water fluoridation. new york state coalition opposed to fluoridation inc. nyscof reported that rates of tooth decay among low income children are on rise even though record numbers of these children are exposed to fluoridated water as well as fluoride from other sources including dental products and medications. data set to be presented at american public health association apha meeting in november 2016 revealed 40 percent of 3- to 5-year olds living 100 percent below federal poverty level have tooth decay along with 69 percent of 6- to 9-year olds and 74 percent of 13- to 15-year olds. rates of dental fluorosis also rose among this population with 58 percent of low income children affected by this condition.12 paul beeber nyscof president said in news release:13 risks of water fluoridation are scientifically proven in 2015 cochrane collaboration released comprehensive review with points that are nearly impossible to dispute. fluoride does nt work to prevent cavities and its proven to cause harm in form of dental fluorosis. cochrane collaboration is considered to be gold standard in evidence based reviews and only three studies conducted since 1975 had enough merit to be included. none showed that swallowing fluoride prevents cavities while it was clear that it causes harm dental fluorosis. dental fluorosis condition referring to changes in appearance of tooth enamel caused by long term ingestion of fluoride is not purely aesthetic. it can lead to crumbling of tooth enamel in its advanced stages and consuming excess fluoride is also linked to learning problems thyroid disease and bone problems. worse still even best studies identified by cochrane collaboration were not considered to be high quality and nearly all were flawed for instance failing to control for other contributing factors such as dietary sources of fluoride aside from tap water diet and ethnicity. its important to understand that effects of fluoride are cumulative which means consuming it via your tap water daily for lifetime may lead to increasingly worsening symptoms of fluoride poisoning although children are also at increased risk of harm. research for instance has linked fluoridated water consumption to thyroid dysfunction weight gain and depression. your pineal gland also tends to accumulate significant amounts of fluoride which eventually causes it to calcify. this may lead to adhd like symptoms and may also play role in alzheimers and bipolar disease. considering its effect on neurotransmitters its also quite conceivable that it might promote depression and other neurological disorders.14 further according to one 500-page scientific review fluoride is endocrine disruptor that can also affect your bones brain and even your blood sugar levels.15 there are more than 100 published studies illustrating fluorides harm to brain alone plus 43 more that directly link fluoride exposure to reduced iq in children. studies have also demonstrated that fluoride toxicity caused by overexposure can lead to help end practice of fluoridation there s no doubt about it fluoride should not be ingested. even scientists from epas national health and environmental effects research laboratory have classified fluoride as chemical having substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity. furthermore according to centers for disease control and prevention cdc 41 percent of american adolescents now have dental fluorosis unattractive discoloration and mottling of teeth that indicate overexposure to fluoride. clearly children are being overexposed and their health and development put in jeopardy. why. only real solution is to stop archaic practice of water fluoridation in first place. fortunately fluoride action network fan has game plan to end water fluoridation worldwide. clean pure water is prerequisite to optimal health. industrial chemicals drugs and other toxic additives really have no place in our water supplies. so please protect your drinking water and support

and obesity. ,natural news when it comes to superfoods corn may be last thing most people think of. after all it is one of most genetically modified crops in states. but locally grown organic corn does have nutritional benefits and researchers from university of illinois developed new kinds of purple corn zea mays l. to study how different combinations of phenolic compounds may impact their anti inflammatory anti obesity and anti diabetic potential. their findings appeared in journal food chemistry. phenolic compounds that give purple corn its hue have anti obesity and anti diabetes potential corn kernels have outer layer called pericarp which is part that shows their different colors. this part also houses phenolic compounds that give maize their nutritional benefits. for current study researchers used strain of maize called apache red to develop 20 varieties of purple corn each with its own unique combination of anthocyanins class of phenols responsible for color of purple corn. according to research anthocyanins can reduce risk of cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and certain cancers. researchers extracted anthocyanins from pericarp of different varieties of purple corn kernels using pressurized water. they then freeze dried aqueous extracts containing anthocyanins prior to analysis. researchers found that pericarp contained high amounts of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds with concentrations varying significantly among different varieties of corn. researchers proceeded to investigate effects of anthocyanin rich extracts on obesity induced inflammation. using mice they combined fat cells called adipocytes with large immune cells called macrophages to simulate cells of obese people with high concentrations of lipids and inflammation. they also examined models that simulated cells of healthy people who regularly consumed plant based foods rich in polyphenols. focusing on specific biomarkers related to inflammation and adipogenesis researchers observed that phenols in extracts altered development of adipocytes reducing their fat content by eight to 56 percent depending on phenols used. next researchers analyzed impact of anthocyanin rich extracts on insulin resistance. to induce insulin resistance they used cell signaling protein in mouse fat cells then treated cells with anthocyanins and monitored glucose uptake. researchers found that depending on phenol content extracts decreased key marker of insulin resistance by 29 to 64 percent. they also decreased glucose uptake by 30 to 139 percent. we observed very important changes in molecules that reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in insulin resistant adipocytes said postdoctoral researcher and study co author diego luna vital. we also found important changes in pro inflammatory molecules in immune cells. based on their findings researchers concluded that different levels and compositions of anthocyanin compounds have impact on biomarkers for obesity inflammation and type 2 diabetes. they added that smaller phenolic compounds like quercetin luteolin and rutin that are also present in extracts played key roles in reducing some of said markers. food science professor and study lead elvira gonzalez de mejia noted that beneficial effects of purple corn extracts resulted from synergistic mechanism of combined phenols rather than just one or two individual compounds. besides potential health benefits researchers believe that pericarp of brightly colored maize like purple corn can be used as natural sources of food colorants giving these kinds of corn added value as staple crop. we calculated that all of red dye no. 40 one of major dyes used in u.s. could be replaced with pigment derived from about 600.000 acres of corn said crop sciences professor and study co author john juvik. and we could produce anthocyanin rich pericarp in sufficient quantities for manufacturers to add it to beverages or special products with pharmaceutical properties. corn comes in many colors blue purple red and even white. different types of corn have varying levels of nutritional benefits. purple corn also known as hopi maize because it was staple of hopi native americans can be found in present day arizona new mexico and colorado. it is also cultivated throughout south america in peru bolivia ecuador and argentina. south american varieties are darker in color than their north american counterparts. darker variant more antioxidants it contains. in fact raw purple corn has nearly 14 times more antioxidants than yellow. these types of corn are not at all genetically modified to have unconventional colors their hues come naturally because of polyphenols they contain particularly anthocyanins. these are same natural compounds responsible for vibrant hues of blueberries and raspberries.,

researchers from gargi college university of delhi came up with list of herbs that show potential in diabetes prevention. this review on anti diabetic properties of herbs and botanical ingredients was published in herbal medicine open access. in 2014 over 422 million people were diagnosed with diabetes and since then this number continues to rise. diabetes is condition wherein there is increased level of glucose in bloodstream. it can be classified into two namely type 1 and type 2 diabetes. first type of diabetes is characterized by insufficient insulin production while type 2 diabetes results from reduced sensitivity to insulin. if left untreated diabetes can lead to further complications such as heart attack stroke blindness and kidney failure. pre diabetes is condition that often precedes type 2 diabetes. people with this condition exhibit elevated glucose levels but not to point where it is considered diabetes. at this point development of diabetes can still be prevented with lifestyle changes and medication. unfortunately medications for pre diabetes can cause unwanted side effects which could include headaches nausea irregular heartbeat and many others. in order to avoid these side effects herbs and other botanical ingredients can be used instead. in this review it was determined that following herbs exhibit anti diabetic activity banaba lagerstroemia speciosa this deciduous tropical flowering tree has leaves with high levels of corosolic acid which can lower glucose and triglyceride levels as well as transport glucose into cells. in addition to this other phytochemicals in banaba leaves can also remediate damaged insulin receptors. bitter melon momordica charantia studies have shown that eating bitter melon can induce pancreas to produce insulin. it can also facilitate glucose transport into cells and lower blood sugar levels. bitter wood quassia amara it has been shown that extracts from bitter wood have potential in treating patients with diabetes caused by high lipid content in bloodstream. silk cotton tree ceiba pentandra although they are mostly cultivated for cotton like fiber that they produce silk cotton tree has also shown potential as pre diabetes treatment since its extracts can regulate glucose levels. holy basil ocimum sanctum this herb is common ayurvedic treatment. it has been shown to regulate blood sugar level. indian gooseberry eugenia jambolana bark and seed of this plant have been shown to lower glucose levels by preventing insulinase from liver and kidney from degrading insulin. shatterstone phyllanthus amarus and phyllanthus niruri aqueous extracts from seed and leaves of phyllanthus amarus which is species of shatterstone has been shown to improve insulin resistance. another species of shatterstone phyllanthus niruri can lower glucose levels suppress rise in glucose levels following glucose meal reduce hemoglobin glycation and increase glycogen content of liver in diabetic rats. ponkoranti salacia oblonga and salacia reticulata stem and roots of s. oblonga are commonly used in ayurveda and traditional indian medicine against diabetes. it works by inhibiting alpha glucosidase enzyme that breaks down oligosaccharides into glucose. meanwhile s. reticulata works by improving serum lipid profiles and glycemic control in patients with prediabetes. ivy gourd this plant has been shown to regulate blood sugar levels. aloe vera aloe barbadensis previous studies have shown that gel of these plants contain active phytosterol compounds that can reduce blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. fenugreek trigonella foenum graecum aside from being common indian spice fenugreek can also inhibit glucose transport increase erythrocyte insulin receptors and improve glucose utilization. it also contains compounds such as fenugreekine and trigonelline which can reduce glucose levels. garlic allium sativum well known garlic contains allicin. this compound does not only give garlic its pungent odor it also induces increased insulin release and reduced glucose levels. cinnamon cinnamomum compound found in cinnamon known as methylhydroxy chalcone polymer can mimic insulin increase glucose metabolism and lower glucose levels. indian kino pterocarpus marsupium tannates found in wood extracts from indian kino can reduce glucose levels. in addition to this indian kino also contains epicatechin which promotes insulin release and conversion of proinsulin to insulin. ginseng studies have shown that ginseng can enhance insulin production and increase available insulin receptors. blueberry vaccinium myrtillus leaves from blueberry plant contain active ingredient that can get rid of excess sugar. collards alpha lipoic acid in collards has ability to lower glucose levels by increasing insulin sensitivity. curry leaves murraya koenigii when ingested leaves of this plant can induce insulin secretion and promote glycogenesis. dandelion taraxacum officinale dandelion can regulate glucose levels by promoting insulin production. in addition to this dandelion can also regulate lipid profile. gumar gymnema sylvestre in hindi plants name translates to sugar destroyer. it lives up to its name by regulating glucose levels promoting glucose ultilization removing sugars from pancreas and inducing insulin production. prickly pear cactus opuntia dillenii eating fruit of this plant can improve sensitivity and response to insulin activity. chamomile matricaria chamomilla studies have shown that chamomile in its tea form can reduce blood sugar levels as well as inhibit sorbitol accumulation in erythrocytes. based on this review there is extensive list of herbs that can prevent pre diabetes from progressing into diabetes. these herbs can therefore be utilized as potential treatments for pre diabetes so that diabetes and unwanted effects of chemical based medicines can be avoided. related diabetes wake up call and how to avoid diabetes. learn more

metabolic syndrome where confluence of inflammatory conditions occur along with diabetes. as result growing evidence appears to show that metabolic syndrome makes diabetic patient susceptible to degenerative health conditions such as cardiovascular disease stroke and now believed alzheimers disease. as diabetes epidemic escalates new sense of urgency has taken hold. proactive strategies for prevention of disease are being put in place by international health organizations such as world health organization who as well as by health departments of industrialized and developing countries and even at local level where food ingredients regulations are being passed. this trimark publications report charts changing landscape of global diabetic population and explores added health concerns resulting from metabolic syndrome phenomenon and one of its major risk factors cardiovascular disease cvd. furthermore this study evaluates widely accepted therapeutic approaches to diabetes that are currently in use while providing in depth analysis of emerging technologies that will be used to treat diabetes and other inflammatory diseases in future. request for sample of this report available

banting and charles best scientists who created first effective treatment for diabetes tea party before it 's news. ,frederick banting and charles best scientists who created first effective treatment for diabetes this week our heroes are frederick banting and charles best two scientists who created first effective treatment for diabetes by successfully extracting hormone insulin from pancreas. thanks to banting and bests work millions of diabetics can now live long healthy lives rather than face early painful death. diabetes is disease that causes persons blood sugar levels to become too high. its symptoms include excessive thirst nausea fatigue sugary urination and weight loss. if left untreated diabetes can lead to complications that include strokes kidney failure heart attacks and nerve damage. diabetes has plagued humanity for thousands of years but even century ago there were no effective treatments. enter frederick banting and charles best. frederick banting was born on november 14 1891 in his familys farmhouse near alliston ontario. in 1912 banting started studying medicine at victoria college part of university of toronto. he joined canadian army in 1915 and graduated year later. in 1918 he was wounded at battle of cambrai and in 1919 he was awarded military cross for heroism under fire. after war banting returned to canada and studied orthopedic medicine. from 1919 to 1920 he was resident surgeon at hospital for sick children toronto and in 1921 he began lecturing in pharmacology at university of toronto. during this time banting became interested in diabetes. banting theorized that if pancreatic duct were closed and trypsin secreting cells died insulin could be extracted from pancreas and then given to diabetics. before 1920s it was known that diabetes resulted from lack of hormone called insulin which is made in pancreas. it was thought that insulin controlled metabolism of sugar. lack of insulin people believed led to increase of sugar in blood. unfortunately previous attempts to extract insulin from pancreas failed because trypsin pancreas own digestive enzyme would break down pure insulin before it could be extracted. banting had to find way of extracting insulin from pancreas before it could be destroyed by organs own digestive enzyme. banting read about 1920 experiment by moses barron russian american scientist who closed pancreatic duct and found that cells that secreted trypsin digestive enzyme deteriorated but cells in pancreas that are responsible for production and release of insulin remained intact. this led banting to theorize that if pancreatic duct were closed and trypsin secreting cells died insulin could be extracted from pancreas and then given to diabetics. in spring of 1921 banting visited j. j. r. macleod professor of physiology at university of toronto to discuss his theory. after lengthy discussion macleod agreed to give banting laboratory space and ten dogs to experiment on. macleod then appointed charles best as bantings assistant. charles best was born in west pembroke maine on february 27 1899. in 1915 best began studying physiology and biochemistry at university of toronto. he enlisted in army in 1918 and after war completed his degree in 1921. in same year he began studying at university of torontos medical school. banting and best started working together and were quickly successful in isolating insulin from test dogs pancreases. after injecting insulin into dogs whose pancreases had been removed they found that dogs who were suffering from their artificially induced diabetes quickly recovered. banting was unhappy that macleod who in bantings view had contributed nothing more than resources was awarded prize. animal insulin is safe for human use and banting and best began taking insulin from larger pancreases found in cows. however they encountered problems refining insulin solution and macleod hired james collip professor of biochemistry at university of alberta to work on purification of insulin. in january 1922 banting and best administered purified insulin into their first ever patient leonard thompson 14-year old diabetic who was close to dying. best and bantings insulin proved to be success as thompson regained his health. use of insulin to treat diabetes quickly spread throughout world. banting received his m.d. in 1922 and in 1923 banting and macleod were jointly awarded nobel prize in physiology or medicine. banting was unhappy that macleod who in bantings view had contributed nothing more than resources was awarded prize. as result banting split his prize money with best. macleod similarly split his prize money with collip. in 1923 banting was elected chair of new banting and best department of medical research which was endowed by legislature of province of ontario. his research focused on silicosis and cancer. in 1925 best was awarded his m.d. and in 1929 he succeeded macleod as professor of physiology at university of toronto. in 1938 banting started working for royal canadian air force researching physiological problems encountered by pilots flying high altitude aircraft. on february 21 1941 banting died of wounds following aircraft crash in which he was passenger. following bantings death best took over as director of banting and best department of medical research. best spent most of his career investigating carbohydrate metabolism he retired in 1965 and eventually died on march 31 1978. thanks to banting and best diabetes went from untreatable condition that has killed millions of people to disease that can be easily treated. banting and best received numerous awards and honorary degrees throughout their lives. both men were members of numerous medical academies. in 1994 they were inducted into canadian medical hall of fame. in 2004 both men were inducted into national inventors hall of fame. thanks to work of frederick banting and charles best diabetes went from untreatable condition that has killed untold millions of people over thousands of years to disease that can be easily treated thus enabling diabetics to lead normal healthy lives. for those reasons frederick banting and charles best are our 24th heroes of progress. this article is republished from human progress.,this week our heroes are frederick banting and charles best two scientists who created first effective treatment for diabetes by successfully extracting hormone insulin from pancreas. thanks to banting and bests work millions of diabetics can now live long healthy lives rather than face early

magnesium protects against heart disease stroke diabetes most of us are deficient ). ,while it is still not commonly held in mainstream discourse that humanity could survive and even thrive without some form of monetary exchange more and more people that are starting to trace their general discontent about contemporary society to its source are finding money and profit motive at root of it. perhaps first of knee jerk reactions some people might have to idea of shifting into money free system is sinking feeling of watching their hard earned wealth evaporate into nothingness which they might equate with abject poverty. we are so programmed to equate money with abundance that we do nt understand what abundance truly is. at heart of it our net abundance is shared and is grounded in resources available in nature on planet. aggregate of these natural resources not only represents our potential abundance but our very survival. money system grants ownership to many of these resources and makes it exponentially easier for those with abundance to get more abundance at expense of vast majority of people. money system is in some ways antithetical to proper management and distribution of these resources. without money each individual would naturally be entitled to their share of all resources in world and that would never change. but how would such system work. jacque fresco founder of venus project believes that world has reached level of technology that will allow us to build fully self sustaining communities all over world which when optimally designed will provide not only unimaginably high level of abundance for all its residents but far greater sense of shared purpose within community. this vision is grounded in principles of resource based economy without profit motive individuals within community will naturally turn their energy towards efficient maintenance of infrastructure and problem solving and innovation for collective as happiness and well being of community is naturally equated with ones own happiness and well being. in video below is brief introduction to frescos inspiring vision of our potential future. more information. including where venus project is at on their timeline is available on their website. no need for trade since money is nothing more than medium of exchange it is only in removing convention of exchange or trade itself that then renders money obsolete. that s why resource based economy proposes that all resources must be declared as common heritage of all earths inhabitants. in his tedx talk colin turner really questions idea that trade is only organizational model for life on planet and in fact outlines ways in which trade is actually antithetical to human abundance and well being we all more or less accept trade as being de facto way of operating our society so much so that we even see it as some kind of universal law. but it might surprise you to know actually that trade has only existed in relatively recent years that in 90 of our modern human history we did nt actually trade at all there still are no archaeological traces of trade. in these early tribal agrarian communities what actually happened was there was implied understanding that everyone in tribe looked after each other. and this was how tribes operated for perhaps vast majority of our early human history. so we see trade now as very important way of doing business and you have to say that trade works i get what i want and you get what you want and we all go home happy. but when you actually scratch surface little bit more about how trade actually pans out in real world its not such nice story. it seems to be better theory than actually works out in practice. for example most obvious case is about 3 billion people in world today live on 2.50 or less daymany of them much much less than that. obviously they are wracked with starvation or dying of curable diseases so i mean you have to ask yourself is trade really working for them for those people. clearly it is nt. colin turner is founder of free world charter which currently has 58.611 signatories among people from 215 different countries and would welcome yours if you are so inclined. charter constitutes set of principles that really formalizes notion that all human individuals are entitled to maintain equal share of earths resources but it also outlines natural responsibilities and practices that each individual would assume in order to live optimally and harmoniously together in money free community and world. here are ten principles highest concern of humanity is combined common good of all living species and biosphere. life is precious in all its forms and free to flourish in combined common good. earths natural resources are birthright of all its inhabitants and free to share in combined common good. every human being is equal part of worldwide community of humans and free citizen of earth. our community is founded on spirit of cooperation and understanding of nature provided through basic education. our community provides for all its members necessities of healthy fulfilling and sustainable life freely and without obligation. our community respects limits of nature and its resources ensuring minimal consumption and waste. our community derives its solutions and advances progress primarily through application of logic and best available knowledge. our community acknowledges its duty of care and compassion for members who are unable to contribute. our community acknowledges its responsibility to maintain diverse and sustainable biosphere for all future life to enjoy these are certainly not final words on which principles should truly define future society and world free of money but in reading them one can clearly grasp overall essence of kind of mindset we will need to develop and implement in our lives if we are to shift into this new paradigm. shift we are looking for here is grounded in conscious move by individuals of this planet away from model of competition and towards model of cooperation. we are all quite familiar with both as we surely have ample amount of experience in both ways of relating to people around us. if you could choose right now which kind of model would you want as basis for entire planet. some might argue that competitive trade money paradigm has been instrumental in getting us to make progress especially technologically which we may not have achieved by remaining with cooperative tribal model. there may be some truth in this. but does it not seem that at this time in history most of us have had it with debt scarcity and inequality that is hallmark of money model. are we not hungering for more love cooperation and shared abundance imbued in very organizational structures we create for ourselves to live. understand that making this change is not as simple as going to united nations or other authoritative world body as jacque fresco has already done. presenting compelling vision of future without money to benefit of all of humanity does not automatically mean that world authority will implement it right away. powers behind world authority like un are actually made up of those who have most money. what we see going on in public arena are essentially machinations of puppets they control. this is nothing new. overall system that maintains power by few has been in place ever since money and exchange were introduced. while in past this wealth was protected over generations and generations by certain families who were visible royalty noblemen and aristocracy of day todays world only differs in sense that these powers are more hidden from sight while countries maintain illusion of having some form of democracy. point is that we will never be able to elicit help of our authority if we want to abandon our current money economy. those in authority who at very top own vast percentage of worlds resources certainly believe they would have most to lose if we moved to model founded on equally shared abundance. what we actually need to do is elicit help of each other energizing important movements and fostering awakening as to how powerful we actually are as collective. when critical mass of us begin marching in step to new way of life current authority will have no power to stop us. money free society and world can certainly work from standpoint of creating abundance for everyone on planet. what is needed is new awareness founded on some of natural principles discussed here. more that individuals of planet slowly move away from competitive money centered practices and spend their time and energy cultivating cooperation more quickly we will be able to collectively walk away from system that no longer serves us.,getting enough magnesium is more important than many of realize and can prevent heart disease type 2 diabetes stroke and many other ailments. magnesium is

contain most actual extracts. second time its pressed as in teabag analogy result is nt as concentrated. coconutdiet.com continues virgin coconut oil can only be achieved by using fresh coconut meat or what is called non copra. chemicals and high heating are not used in further refining since natural pure coconut oil is very stable with shelf life of several years. there are currently two main processes of manufacturing virgin coconut oil quick drying of fresh coconut meat which is then used to press out oil. using this method minimal heat is used to quick dry coconut meat and oil is then pressed out via mechanical means. none wet milling. with this method oil is extracted from fresh coconut meat without drying first. coconut milk is expressed first by pressing. oil is then further separated from water. methods which can be used to separate oil from water include boiling fermentation refrigeration enzymes and mechanical centrifuge. why keep coconut oil in bathroom. raw organic coconut oil besides being good enough to eat which well discuss in minute has plethora of benefits apart from actual ingestion. heres list of 15 benefits of coconut oil in no particular order 1.smooth

based gels and mousses which coat hair prevent it from absorbing moisture and dries out hair shaft. just few drops of coconut oil are all you need for natural hair conditioner for smooth silky shine. virgin coconut oil has been described as having haunting nutty vanilla flavor and even milder and richer tasting than butter. new york times article noted that coconut oil while once demonized by all saturated fats are bad for you camp has now become accepted even applied topically coconut oil has healing properties. one interesting factoid is that while antiperspirants containing aluminum are associated with alzheimers coconut oil actually prevents it because of medium chain fatty acids mcfa that are easily absorbed and metabolized by liver and can convert to ketones. one study noted alzheimers is projected to affect 1 in 4 americans in next generation rivaling obesity and diabetes but evidence suggests that ketone bodies in coconut oil may help restore and renew neurons and nerve function in your brain even after damage has set in. regarding coconut oil in kitchen even as household cleaner there are few points to consider virgin coconut oil has smoke point of 350 degrees so for cooking its best used at lower temperatures. olive oil overcooks even as low as 250 degrees which may cause oxidization doing your body more harm than good. you can substitute coconut oil for butter or olive oil and most definitely instead of so called vegetable oils. heres why multiple studies reveal coconut oil to impart amazing benefits when used in nutritional applications. one of most dramatic changes you can make in your health will be to replace so called healthy vegetable soy corn and cottonseed oils such as canola when sauting food or baking cake or cookies. its interesting to note that polynesian populations who ve been using full fat coconut oil as diet staple for untold generations have no heart disease to speak of. why. its direct contradiction to what conventional medicine touted for few decades that saturated fats are bad for you and will lead to obesity high cholesterol levels heart disease and alzheimers. truth is saturated fat like that of coconut oil and olive oil is natural not concocted substances created in laboratory using methods like hydrogenation and partial hydrogenation that convert polyunsaturated fatty acids to trans fats. vegetable and seed oils undergo double whammy of hydrogen atoms and high heat creating cheaper oil with long shelf life that s very bad for your health. further when vegetable oils are heated to high temperature chemical compounds break down get stuck in your cells oxidize and create dangerous free radicals that lead to disease including heart disease and cancer. heres timeless article on type of oil you

with public in past 10 years. they ve accomplished this despite fact that research in peer reviewed journals has not supported them. this popularity spike has now been exacerbated by entry of big money drug companies into herbal market. they come along with their millions of dollars in promotional activity. now all nay sayers in medical profession who have been saying that herbal treatments are for barefoot doctors and goofy vegetarians may have to eat crow. two long touted herbs are proving to be potent agents in prevention and treatment of adult onset diabetes. this kind i like to call nutritional diabetes as its diabetes one gets later in life from carbohydrate and sugar abuse. in addition proving grounds for these two herbs cinnamon and ginseng are pretty impressive. as for cinnamon researchers from u.s. agricultural research service in maryland say herb may prevent diabetes by helping body use insulin more efficiently. researchers have identified chemical called methyl hydroxy chalcone polymer in cinnamon. it works reports new scientist magazine by making fat cells more responsive to insulin. heres why this is important experts call nutritional diabetes insulin resistant diabetes in trade because body does nt use insulin it has. therefore blood sugar level goes up. in childhood diabetes glands in pancreas that make insulin go on strike and do nt manufacture any more insulin. this is called type i diabetes. nutritionist richard anderson of agricultural research service said we recommend people take quarter to full teaspoon day of cinnamon perhaps in orange juice coffee or on oatmeal. thus far researchers have only conducted tests on laboratory mice. however studies have demonstrated that chemical in cinnamon methyl hydroxy chalcone polymer can

mainstream medicine between eyes is ginseng steady favorite with alternative medicine supporters. until now big boys have nt promoted ginseng because they did nt have scientific handle for it. there was nothing in respected journals about ginseng. this is euphemistic way of saying they did nt have way around ever watchful fda. now ginseng is coming out of medicine closet because there is very impressive report on this ancient remedy by respected university. panax quinquefolius american ginseng is ready to be major player in therapy for diabetes. this is because of impressive research reported in archives of internal medicine. drs. vuksan sievenpiper koo uljan beljan zdravkovic and xu did their research at department of nutritional sciences within university of toronto. experiment was uncomplicated and consequently not subject to many uncontrollable variables. this is kind of study that you can usually trust. group of type ii diabetics was matched with healthy controls. doctors gave them three grams of ginseng or placebo capsules. they did this either 40 minutes before or together with 25-gram oral glucose dose of sugar. placebo capsules contained corn flour in which quantity of carbohydrates and appearance matched ginseng capsules. blood samples were taken while fasting as well as periodically up to two hours after glucose challenge. in non diabetic subjects researchers found no differences in blood sugar levels between placebo and ginseng when taken together prior to glucose challenge. when ginseng was taken 40 minutes before glucose challenge there was significant reduction in blood sugar in these normal subjects. precautions you should consider when using cinnamon and ginseng important normal non diabetic people should not take american ginseng except with meals to avoid hypoglycemic symptoms such as irritability fainting and nervousness. in subjects with diabetes same low sugar response occurred whether capsules were taken before or together with glucose challenge. reductions in blood sugar were 18 31 percent for healthy subjects and 1.922 2.217 percent for subjects with diabetes when ginseng administered was before or together with glucose challenge. this is indeed impressive finding. its two giant steps forward for herbal treatment of serious disease. but be careful. this absolutely does not mean that you can gorge on cinnamon and ginseng and go back to your old bad habits. its not that simple as type ii diabetics have found out. they thought they could just take insulin and eat all sugar and starch they wanted. you still have to watch what you eat. there is no santa claus for curing diabetes. this powerful supplement is not for everyone. actions you can take to manage diabetes action number one include cinnamon and ginseng in your diet if you re at risk of getting diabetes or already have diabetes you should include cinnamon and ginseng in your diet on regular basis. another treatment you need to consider for treating type ii diabetes is testosterone therapy. even with severe diabetes testosterone therapy can be of great benefit including treatment of dreaded diabetic retinopathy which leads to blindness. dr. m.l. tainter reported in new york state journal of medicine that testosterone therapy improved vision or at least stopped deterioration of vision in 75 percent of cases. to find out more about this therapy talk to alternative minded doctor who understands hormone therapy. try chelation therapy as it reduces insulin requirements in some cases of adult onset diabetes. stop eating so much sugar and starch potatoes etc. and do nt watch so much tv. i reported couple of months ago that watching tv causes your heart rate to slow down. when your heart rate slows down it causes your metabolism to slow down. this negative process causes your body to burn fat slower thereby contributing to diabetes. instead eat diet rich in protein and healthy fats and go for long walk each day if

before it 's news.,type 2 diabetes can be reversed by diet type 2 diabetes is not disease. its condition brought on as result of diet. diabetes rates in americans are high and rising higher because of our western grain based and sugar laced processed food diet. in type 2 diabetes pancreas makes enough insulin but blood sugar levels increase so that cell membranes are triggered to become insulin resistant. in response pancreas makes more insulin. over time insulin receptors in cell membranes begin to function abnormally. when blood sugar levels remain high all time damage to cells of organ systems is result. so what we have is situation where high insulin is symptom we are getting denoting that something is wrong. it is in fact flashing danger signal of biggest chronic disease threats we have today including osteoporosis heart disease alzheimers and cancer. if you go to american diabetes association website they will tell you that scientists do nt know exact cause of type 2 diabetes and associate with certain risk factors. these include in other words ada wants you to believe that there is not much you can do about your diabetes. true its not really your fault you have this condition considering all hidden sugar and unhealthy grains you ve been told to eat. but they also want you to think that all that can be done is treat symptoms and take your prescriptions. why. insulin they sell via prescription is synthetic patented and price has quadrupled in recent times. nowhere does ada tell people they have power to cure their diabetes themselves. why would they. it would cut into their profits. nationally almost 80 million people have diabetes or pre diabetes. according to centers for disease control and prevention diabetes is seventh leading cause of death in u.s. that means it is big business just like cancer treatments and heart treatments are big business and means lots of money for medical industrial establishment. professor roy taylor of newcastle university in great britain has spent years researching diabetes and diet. his research has proven that type 2 diabetes does nt have to be life long prison sentence of insulin shots and pharmaceuticals. it can be reversed even among those who have had diabetes for up to 10 years and health can be restored through major weight loss and diet changes. taylor has conducted two separate studies on people with type 2 diabetes from randomly selected british general medical practices. in both studies patients were put on diets of 600 700 calories day. first study group included people who had diabetes for only few years. second study involved people with diabetes for eight years to 23 years. participants lost average of 31 pounds and before six months had passed almost every patient who had suffered from diabetes for 10 years or less were diabetes free. others saw their diabetes reversed after six months. even though most participants were still overweight or obese at end of six months they had lost enough weight to remove fat from pancreas which allowed normal insulin production to resume. what we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes even if you have had condition for long time up to around 10 years. taylor said. if you have had diagnosis for longer than that then do nt give up hope major improvement in blood sugar control is possible. study also answered question that people often ask me if i lose weight and keep weight off will i stay free of diabetes. simple answer is yes. interestingly even though all our volunteers remained obese or overweight fat did not drift back to clog up pancreas. this supports our theory of personal fat threshold. if person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate then diabetes is triggered but if they then lose that amount of weight then they go back to normal. to lose weight study participants used diet of three special shakes day along with 8 ounces of non starchy vegetables for 8 weeks. over next two weeks they began to resume eating normal food under strict instructions. patients were evaluated each month and given individualized weight maintenance program that had them eating about one third less than they were eating pre diet. diabetes uk which provided grant for taylors work has list of diets to help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight on its website. but it boils down to avoiding all processed foods and sugars. unfortunately most people choose easy route and eat processed foods. processed foods are foods we buy already prepared and foods that we cook. processed foods are those we find in center of grocery stores. these are incomplete foods mostly dead and unable to support life. obesity and diabetes can be combated by simply changing your diet to raw fruits and vegetables. your diet should be primarily organic fruits and vegetables mostly raw especially dark green leafy vegetables like kale mustard greens collard greens swiss chard watercress spinach and arugula other green vegetables like romaine bok choy cabbage brussels sprouts asparagus broccoli string beans snow peas and green peas non green but nutrient rich vegetables like beets eggplant mushrooms onions radishes bean sprouts red and yellow bell peppers radicchio cauliflower tomatoes artichokes and raw carrots. our diet should be 80 percent vegetables organic with only 20 percent meats preferably free range and not exposed to gmos or antibiotics. one good diet to follow is nutritarian diet by joel furhman and no i m not receiving kickback or compensation for this recommendation. if you feel you must eat meat stick to meat from free range animals that have not been fed genetically modified foods or subjected to antibiotics. keep your meat diet heavy on fish consumption but not farm raised those animals usually have been fed gmos and heavily medicated. post type 2 diabetes can be reversed by diet appeared first on personal liberty.,type 2 diabetes is not disease. its condition brought on as result of diet. diabetes rates in americans are high and rising higher ....

diet drinks may raise diabetes risk health before it 's news. ,drinking more than two sugary or artificially sweetened soft drinks per day greatly increases risk of diabetes research has shown guardian reports. research was swedish cohort study of sweetened drink consumption over past year for people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. they also looked at people with uncommon form of diabetes known as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults lada which shares features with type 1 and 2 diabetes. both groups were then compared with diabetes free control group. drinking more than two sweetened drinks per day was linked with being roughly twice as likely to have diabetes. for type 2 diabetes link was similar when separately analysing sugary and diet drinks. link with lada was little weaker and did not stand up to statistical significance when separately analysing sugary and artificially sweetened drinks. however this study can not prove that sweetened drinks alone have directly caused these conditions. other unhealthy lifestyle factors like smoking and poor diet in general were also linked with two forms of diabetes. also one of hallmark symptoms of diabetes is increased thirst so it could be possible that in some cases diabetes came first and was then followed by increased consumption of sweetened drinks. these uncertainties aside results broadly support our understanding of risk factors for diabetes which also apply to several other chronic diseases. to reduce your risk of diabetes eat healthy diet exercise regularly stop smoking and cut down on alcohol consumption. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from karolinska institutet stockholm and other institutions in sweden and finland. funding was provided by swedish research council swedish research council for health working life and welfare afa insurance and swedish diabetes association. study was published in peer reviewed european journal of endocrinology and is openly available to access online. uk media gives slightly confused reporting by dividing between reporting on diet drinks or sugary drinks. all media reports mentioned two drinks per day. significant links were actually for more than two drinks per day for example two and half or three. there were no links for two or fewer drinks of any type. in any case with food frequency questions there is chance that estimates on portion size or frequency may be inaccurate. what kind of research was this. this was case control study within population based swedish cohort study that aimed to see whether consumption of sweetened drinks was associated with risk of rare form of diabetes called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults lada. lada has features of type 1 diabetes where bodys own immune cells destroy insulin producing cells in pancreas. but unlike type 1 diabetes which normally develops in childhood in lada cell destruction is much slower. also condition often develops later in life and shares many features with type 2 diabetes. for example person does nt always need treatment with insulin straight away. this study reports that in swedish diabetes registry lada accounts for 5 of all cases. researchers compared drink consumption between cases with lada or conventional type 2 diabetes and diabetes free controls. difficulty with this study design is that its always going to be difficult to prove that single factor such as sweetened drinks is definitely cause of condition. what did research involve. study used data from population based cohort study estrid epidemiological study of risk factors for lada and type 2 diabetes which started in 2010. this study invited people with lada or type 2 diabetes from swedish diabetes registry to take part along with random selection of people aged 35 or over who were free from diabetes to act as controls. participants were set to be recruited in ratio of four people with type 2 diabetes and six controls for every one person with lada. all people with diabetes were diagnosed by doctor. there are said to be no definite criteria for lada diagnosis but study used criteria in line with other literature. participants completed health and lifestyle questionnaire. this included information on weight and height physical activity smoking alcohol intake family history of diabetes and educational level. these factors were considered as potential confounders. they also completed 132-item food frequency questionnaire. participants were asked to report their normal food consumption in preceding year. three questions asked about intake of sweetened drinks other diet soft drinks soda for example diluted syrups they were asked to report number of 200ml servings per day or per week. questions on fruit juice were nt analysed in study. researchers analysed difference in sweetened drink consumption between cases and controls adjusting for other confounders. what were basic results. data was available for 1.136 people with type 2 diabetes 357 people with lada and 1.371 diabetes free controls. average age was 59 for people with lada and controls and 68 for those with type 2 diabetes. just under two thirds of all people reported consuming sweetened including artificially sweetened drinks. in general they found that consumption of sweetened drinks was linked with higher body mass index bmi and other poor lifestyle factors like smoking low physical activity and consumption of processed meat and sugary foods. in adjusted analyses people drinking more than two servings of any sweetened drinks day had almost doubled odds of lada compared with non consumers odds ratio or 1.99 95 confidence interval ci 1.11 to 3.56. each extra daily serving was linked with 15 increased risk or 1.15 95 ci 1.02 to 1.29. for type 2 diabetes link was little stronger. more than two servings day was linked with more than twice odds of type 2 compared with non consumers or 2.39 95 ci 1.39 to 4.09 and each extra daily serving conferred 20 increased risk or 1.20 95 ci 1.07 to 1.34. when separately analysing both sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks findings were similar and still significant for type 2 diabetes. however for lada all links fell short of statistical significance on separate analysis. drinking two or fewer drinks per day either sugar sweetened or artificially sweetened drinks was not linked with either lada or type 2 diabetes. how did researchers interpret results. researchers conclude high intake of sweetened beverages was associated with increased risk of lada. observed relationship resembled that with type 2 diabetes suggesting common pathways possibly involving insulin resistance. this study primarily aimed to see if consuming sweetened drinks was associated with rarer condition of lada as it is with type 2 diabetes. researchers found that having more than two drinks per day was linked with increased odds of both conditions though link with lada was little weaker and not statistically significant when separately analysing diet and sugary drinks. they also found that high bmi and other poor lifestyle choices were also linked with conditions. findings generally support what is understood about type 2 diabetes that high sugar intake poor diet low activity and high bmi increase risk. they similarly show that this is also likely to be case with this rarer variant of condition. there are couple of points to note this study design can not prove that sweetened drinks are direct cause of diabetes in these people. it is likely that high consumption of sweetened drinks is part of wider picture of generally poor lifestyle habits. though researchers have adjusted their analyses for confounding factors it is difficult to fully account for each health and lifestyle variable that could be having influence. results are based on food frequency questionnaire assessing intake over past year. though this is best way you can look at this it may not be entirely accurate particularly when questioning regular portion size or reflect longer term patterns over course of persons lifetime. several of these analyses deal with small numbers. for example only 14 people with lada drank more than two servings of diet drinks day. analyses based on small numbers are generally less reliable than those based on larger numbers of people. this is swedish cohort. lifestyle and environmental differences may mean study is not completely representative of uk population. one expert from university of cambridge also considers another possibility that increased drink consumption could be due to increased thirst before diabetes is diagnosed that is study ca nt rule out that this finding could be symptom rather than cause of diabetes. researchers did try and take account of consumption of water and other drinks as general marker of thirst but this is still possibility study design ca nt rule out. nevertheless findings support current understanding of risk factors for diabetes which apply to several other chronic diseases. to reduce your risk of diabetes as well as heart disease stroke and some cancers eat healthy diet exercise regularly do nt smoke and cut down on alcohol consumption. just two sugary drinks day greatly increases diabetes risk study shows. guardian october 21 2016 two diet drinks day could double risk of diabetes study

take insulin or medication again of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. what disease affects every other american and one in four kids. type 2 diabetes or pre diabetes. type 2 diabetes in america has tripled since 1980s and researchers estimate one in three americans will have diabetes by mid century. more than one third of american adults are obese1. and one in three medicare dollars is spent on diabetes making it biggest driver of our federal debt. sadly these numbers continue to increase. overall its not pretty picture and experts predict things will only become worse. i use term diabesity to describe continuum of health problems ranging from mild insulin resistance and overweight to obesity and diabetes. diabesity is underlying cause of most heart disease cancer and premature death in world. tragically these conditions are also 100 preventable and reversible. most people believe diabetes is not reversible. that s unfortunate considering its numerous complications including kidney failure amputation stroke and dementia. i ve also heard experts claim obesity is difficult to treat and maintaining long term weight loss is almost impossible. i wholeheartedly disagree. science shows diabetes and obesity are preventable and reversible with aggressive utilize nutrition and lifestyle modifications. it is caused by 152 pounds of sugar and 146 pounds of flour year eaten on average by every american that is toxic drug dose of diabetes causing food. it is well known that massively obese patients can reverse their diabetes within few weeks of getting gastric bypass even if they have nt lost that much weight. why. because food is medicine and when you take disease producing food out and put right food in healing happens quickly. i recently had patient lose 45 pounds and get off 54 units of insulin and all his diabetes medication. 7 strategies to help prevent treat and reverse diabesity i implement these seven strategies every day with patients to prevent treat and reverse diabesity without drugs and surgery. diet full of empty calories and quickly absorbed sugar liquid sugar calories and refined carbohydrates all of which convert to sugar creates high insulin levels eventually leading to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. among many problems of chronically high insulin levels include inflammation high blood pressure poor sex drive increased risk for cancer and depression. most important thing you can do to reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity or reversing its impact is to eliminate or dramatically reduce sugar in all its many disguises. 2. stock up on whole unprocessed foods whole unprocessed real foods balance your blood sugar reduce inflammation and oxidative stress and improve your liver detoxification to prevent or reverse insulin resistance and diabetes. choose rich variety of colorful fruits and vegetables plenty of omega-3 fats coconut butter and olive oil legumes nuts and seeds. whole real foods turn on all right gene messages promote healthy metabolism reverse insulin resistance and diabetes and prevent aging and age related diseases like diabetes and heart disease. 3. get right nutrients supplements make your cells more sensitive to insulin and more effective at metabolizing sugar and fat. combined with right diet and lifestyle modifications they can help you balance blood sugar and reverse or prevent diabetes. at very minimum i recommend one to two grams of omega 3 fatty acids 5 to 5 grams of pgx unique type of fiber that controls appetite and blood sugar before each meal with eight ounces of water other nutrients also play role in balancing blood sugar and normalizing insulin levels and i ve discussed these more fully in my book blood sugar solution or on this page. 4. get right exercise you need nt spend hours at gym to get exercises benefits. even 30-minute walk can help. vigorous is key for effective exercise that helps balance blood sugar and lower insulin levels. get your heart rate up to 70 80 of its maximum capacity for 60 minutes up to six times week. step it up few notches with high intensity interval training hiit and strength training.studies show hiit can benefit type 2 diabetes2 and obesity3. best of all you can do it in just minutes day. lack of sleep or poor sleep damages your metabolism spikes sugar and carb cravings makes you eat more and increases your risk for numerous diseases including type 2 diabetes. one study among healthy subjects found even partial nights poor sleep4 could induce insulin resistance. that s why you must prioritize sleep so you get eight hours of solid uninterrupted shuteye every night. create sleep ritual that includes herbal therapies creating total darkness and quiet and relaxing with my ultrabath. in face of chronic stress our levels of insulin cortisol and inflammatory compounds called cytokines all increase. this drives relentless metabolic dysfunction that leads to weight gain insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes. links between stress weight gain mental disorders and blood sugar imbalances show that managing stress becomes critical component of obesity and diabetes management. you ca nt eliminate stress but you can learn to control it. meditation deep breathing exercises yoga massage laughing and dancing is among best ways to manage stress and reverse type 2 diabetes. check out my blog to learn five ways to never be stressed again. research shows that people who track their results lose twice as much weight and do twice as well. begin by getting journal to track your progress in. that could be as simple as pad of paper notebook spreadsheet in your computer or whatever is convenient and works for you. now what should you track. in addition to what you eat you ll want to get baseline of all measurements your weight weight waist size body mass index bmi and blood pressure optional. many patients become inspired when they see their results on

risk health before it 's news. ,researchers have found links between genetic variations known to affect storage of fat in body and type 2 diabetes as well as heart attacks and strokes. people can store fat tissue in different ways such as in their legs and arms. while this may be cosmetically unsightly it is healthier than storing fat in abdomen known as visceral fat especially around liver and pancreas. this type of distribution is associated with insulin resistance where cells in body fail to respond to hormone insulin and type 2 diabetes. this difference in fat distribution could partly explain why not all obese people develop type 2 diabetes and conversely why some people of normal weight develop type 2 diabetes. study was based on data on around 200.000 people from uk and europe. in addition to link between body fat distribution and insulin resistance researchers also found variations in 53 genetic areas increased risk of insulin resistance which leads to type 2 diabetes. previously only 10 genetic areas had been implicated. greater number of these variations higher risk. though study found links between these genetic areas and fat distribution this type of study can not prove cause and effect. but it may help target future prevention and treatment strategies such as medications designed to target fat. in meantime you can still reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle choices like eating healthy balanced diet stopping smoking reducing how much alcohol you drink and exercising regularly. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from university of cambridge wellcome trust sanger institute university of oxford university of exeter university of geneva university of california and national heart lung and blood institute in us. it was published in peer reviewed journal nature genetics and was funded by uk medical research council. authors declare no competing financial interests. bbc news reported story accurately linking inability to store fat safely to increased risk of diabetes. what kind of research was this. this was meta analysis of studies investigating influence of genetic variants on insulin and fat characteristics. research aimed to look at variation in genes associated with patterns in fat deposits and insulin resistance. meta analyses provide useful way of summarising multiple studies looking at same outcomes in this case insulin resistance and storage of fat. however this type of study is only as good as individual studies included and any weaknesses of these studies will be brought into analysis. studies included were population based cohort studies mostly from uk and europe. cohort studies are practical way of looking at link between two factors but can not prove one genetic make up causes another insulin resistance and location of fat deposits. what did research involve. researchers took 188.577 individuals from five population studies that analysed genetic make up of these individuals to identify variations in genes associated with insulin resistance. they then looked at how genetic variations played role in cardiometabolic diseases. this is general term used to refer to diseases related to underlying problems with metabolism and bloodflow such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. researchers looked at cardiometabolic traits and outcomes in people. levels of fat in certain areas of body in those who were found to be at highest genetic risk for cardiometabolic disease including type 2 diabetes were compared with those at lowest risk. leg fat mass was used as indicator for peripheral fat which is not in central areas. what were basic results. genetic predisposition to insulin resistance through 53 genetic areas produced higher risk of diabetes but lower levels of fat beneath skin. looking at people with and without type 2 diabetes 53 genetic variants were associated with 12 increased risk of type 2 diabetes 95 confidence interval ci 1.11 to 1.14. no differences were found between genders or across body mass index categories. people with higher number of 53 genetic variants were more likely to have lower proportion of fat in their legs and greater waist circumference. how did researchers interpret results. researchers concluded that their findings implicate primary effect on impaired adipose fat function and secondary effect on insulin resistance. they further added that their findings support notion that limited capacity of peripheral adipose tissue to store surplus energy is implicated in human insulin resistance and related cardiometabolic disease in general population. insulin is hormone in body that helps control blood sugar levels. when resistance to insulin occurs blood sugar levels and lipids fats rise increasing risk of diabetes and heart disease. this study shows that 53 separate genetic variants were associated with insulin resistance underpinned by association with lower levels of fat in peripheral regions particularly in lower half of body but conversely possibly higher levels of fat around liver and pancreas. while study has strengths such as using very large number of people and did demonstrate link between genetic variants and insulin resistance there were limitations. data was compiled from number of different studies which may have each had their own limitations. majority were prospective cohort studies which while helping to show association can not prove that these genetic variations cause insulin resistance. there may be wide range of other factors affecting risk of insulin resistance and subsequent type 2 diabetes such as lifestyle factors including eating unhealthily and not being active. other factors that can influence insulin resistance include age being asian or african caribbean or having polycystic ovary syndrome. symptoms of diabetes include feeling thirsty passing more urine than usual feeling very tired and weight

's news.,first primer on what type 2 diabetes is blood glucose governs your bodys energy and under normal conditions complicated set of interactions move glucose from blood into muscle cells as quickly as possible. in type 2 diabetes blood sugar glucose levels rise higher than normal because body makes insulinthe key hormone for regulating blood sugarbut ca nt use it properly. nearly 30 million americansa number that has doubled over last two decadeshave type 2 diabetes. despite its prevalence misinformation surrounds disease from what causes it to which foods are forbidden and even how to treat it. here experts reveal biggest diabetes myths and set record straight. myth type 2 diabetes is not that serious not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs insulin so it may not seem that serious says sarfraz zaidi md endocrinologist at los robles hospital in thousand oaks calif. in reality its silent killer also because those with type 2 do nt have many symptoms he says. in actuality type 2 is more complex than type 1 says dr. zaidi who describes type 2 diabetes as manifestation of underlying disease process called insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. this causes high blood pressure heart disease and contributes to growth of cancer and gout he says. myth symptoms of type 2 diabetes are easy to spot nearly 28 of people who have type 2 diabetes do nt even realize it. while symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are very similarincreased urination and thirst fatigue blurred vision among otherstype 1 symptoms tend to have dramatic and abrupt onset usually in children and adolescents but sometimes adults while type 2 comes on much more slowly. many people can walk around with type 2 diabetes for years without showing symptoms says dr. zaidi. your blood sugar may be mildly elevated in early stages of disease but you would nt know it without blood test. however even this mild elevationknow as prediabetesis thought to be dangerous raising risk for heart attacks and other problems. chances are you ve spotted online ads for supplements and vitamins that promise to eliminate diabetes. that may explain why people with diabetes are more likely to use dietary supplements and herbal therapies than people without diabetes according to american diabetes association. everyone wants magic bullet says dr. zaidi. they think if i take this pill for couple of weeks i do nt have to worry about anything but its not true. stick with well researched medication prescribed by your doctor and if you d like to take supplement in addition to standard medication consult your md first. myth eating too many sweets causes type 2 diabetes its old wives tale that diabetes is caused by eating sugar and candy. what definitely does increase your risk of type 2 being overweight or obese and of course consuming too much sugar or calories from any other source could cause weight gain. anyone can develop type 2 diabetes even life long athletes like billie jean king. all it takes is right combination of lifestyle factors and genetics says gerald bernstein md endocrinologist and director of diabetes management program at beth israel medical center in new york city. in past most people were diagnosed in their 60s or 70s. extra pounds speed up diagnosis meaning more people now get diabetes in their 30s 40s or 50s or even younger. related health benefits of licorice you have never heard of. part of essence of prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes is exercise says dr. bernstein. exercise burns glucose and makes cells more sensitive to insulin he says. this better enables your cells to take up glucose during and after activity. exercise may even be more effective than diabetes drugs when it comes to preventing disease in people most at risk. in study published in new england journal of medicine people with prediabetes were given placebo drug metformin or were prescribed lifestyle modification program with goal of 7 weight loss and at least 150 minutes of exercise week. after about three years lifestyle interventions reduced diabetes incidence by 58 while drug reduced it just 31 as compared with placebo. drugs alone are not answer says dr. zaidi. myth if you have diabetes you can never eat sugar eating more sweets does nt cause diabetes and those with diabetes can eat sugary foods from time to time says joel zonszein md director of clinical diabetes center at montefiore medical center in bronx new york. american diabetes association recommends keeping sweets and dessert portions small since most sweets contain high amounts of carbohydrates. diabetics can swap out small portion of dessert for another carb heavy food in your meal. for example substitute small portion of pumpkin pie for dinner roll or sweet potatoes in main course. although obese and overweight people are at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes thin people can also become diabetic says dr. zaidi. ethnicity plays big role he says. populations at higher risk for type 2 diabetes in general includes african americans alaska natives japanese chinese koreans american indians and hispanics latinos. family history of diabetes also makes it more likely you ll develop disease. more research is needed to determine exactly why minority groups have higher type 2 diabetes risk but some believe these groups may have inherited thrifty gene that helped their ancestors get through alternating periods of feast and faminein other words their bodies cling to fat to prepare for long periods without food evolutionary adaptation that s no longer necessary. others believe that poverty and lack of access to health care play role. myth diabetes means you have to give yourself shots type 2 diabetes rarely requires insulin shots dr. zonszein says. if you need insulin shots its likely only one injection day and without any diabetes pill. managing type 2 diabetes more frequently includes stress reduction diet exercise and oral medication says dr. zaidi. stress increases blood sugar levels substantially he says. along with diet and exercise dr. zaidi recommends practicing mindfulness as way to avoid blood sugar spikes due to stress. be in now keep your mind and body in same place. myth its easy to tell if your blood sugar is high by how you feel typical symptoms of high blood sugar include increased thirst and urination dry mouth fatigue and blurred vision. low blood sugar may trigger shakiness sweating irritability dizziness and lack of coordination. but often those with diabetes adjust to these feelings and do nt know their true blood sugar without checking it says david kerr md director of research and development at william sansum diabetes center in santa barbara calif. brain can adjust to high and low blood sugars and rarely can person feel when their sugars low or high. it requires blood test to know for sure. myth if you do nt take care of your diabetes you ll end up on insulin around 25 of people developing type 2 diabetes will need insulin. its not because they have done anything wrong simply that insulin producing cells in pancreas have become so fatigued they can not produce enough insulin to cope with demands of food dr. kerr says. this insulin exhaustion is often worse in those who are overweight as this given amount of insulin is less effective at keeping blood glucose levels under control. related 10 of most cancer causing foods you need to avoid insulin does not cause weight gain on its own but people going on insulin often do report weight gain says dr. kerr. insulin injections make person super efficient at keeping hold of any excess calories that they previously lost through kidneys when diet was not as well controlled he explains. if this happens check with your doctor to be sure you re not on too much insulin. this can cause excess weight gain when people feed up their insulin to stop their blood glucose levels from going too low says dr. kerr. myth once you re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes you have it for life lot of people who develop type 2 diabetes are carrying excess weight says dr. kerr. and they often do nt exercise as much as they should. good news is that if you re overweight and have type 2 diabetes losing extra pounds by cutting portion sizes and exercising more will be beneficial. in some cases people can even reverse diabetes process especially if those lifestyle changes happen as soon as diabetes is diagnosed. in one study losing average of 15 pounds through lifestyle changes reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 over three years. myth diabetes is same for everyone symptoms dietary approaches and reactions to various foods all vary individually in type 2 diabetes says dr. zaidi. some people have no symptoms until they experience heart attack. while in hospital they find out their blood sugar is sky high but they had no prior idea they were diabetic. whether or not you exercise can play significant role in determining your blood sugar after eating certain food as well says dr. zaidi. you can give same number of calories to two different people and their blood sugar may be different depending on fitness level and even ethnicity. keeping food diary with foods and blood sugar reactions two hours after meal helps determine individuals reaction to specific foods he says. left uncontrolled diabetes can cause serious damage including heart disease and stroke blindness kidney disease and loss of limb. but risk can be greatly reduced by keeping blood sugar under control says dan nadeau md endocrinologist at allen diabetes center at hoag hospital in orange county calif. better glucose blood sugar control right medications and smart choices about foods are critical for reducing risk of complications. working to achieve ideal weight is another powerful tool to avoid complications. early detection helps reduce risk of complications along with regular eye exams urine tests and foot exams. carlos gonzalez what to do if your child wo nt eat are you fertility aware. 6 points experts want you to know easy ways to use apple cider vinegar for kidney stones.,truth about

plant that could treat diabetes and kill cancer cells alternative before it 's news. ,bitter melon is fruit that grows abundantly in asia africa and caribbean. traditionally it has been used to treat diabetes and other more mild diseases or illnesses. more recently bitter melon juice was shown to kill pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice in study done by university of colorado. considering results were seen in both in vitro and in vivo tests effectiveness of bitter melon juice in treating pancreatic cancer and potentially other cancers at clinical level are promising.[1 pancreatic cancer is one of most difficult cancers to treat due to fact that it is often discovered late leaving very little time to treat. since traditional therapies chemotherapy radiation surgery etc were not showing promising results and littler advancement was being made researchers have been looking elsewhere to find treatment. interestingly cannabis specifically cannabinoids have been shown to induce apoptic programmed death of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and stop pancreatic tumor growth in vivo.[4 cannabis is perhaps one of most popular treatments being aggressively pursued right now given its promising results both in labs and anecdotally. many cancerous tumors have insulin receptors which move glucose to cancer cells helping them to grow and divide. studies have shown that insulin encourages pancreatic cancer cells to grow in dose dependant manner since bitter melon has been shown to help regulate insulin levels this could help prevent pancreatic cancer over long term. colorado university study was led by dr. rajesh agarwal. they examined effects of bitter melon on 4 different lines of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in mice. for in vivo studies mice were injected with pancreatic tumor cells and were randomly divided into one of two groups. one group of mice received water which was control group and other group was given bitter melon juice for six weeks.[6 researchers studied tumors at end of study and results showed that bitter melon juice not only inhibited cancer cell proliferation but also induced apoptosis programmed cell death. compared to control tumor growth was inhibited by 60 in treatment group and there were no signs of toxicity or negative effects on body. with toxicity and negative effects being huge role in traditional mainstream treatments this was positive to see. number of clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate efficacy of bitter melon for treating diabetes. since it is believed that diabetes is precursor for pancreatic cancer researchers felt bitter melon could treat diabetes as well after seeing pancreatic cancer results. in 2011 results of four week long clinical trial were published in journal of ethnopharmacology that showed modest hypoglycemic effects and significant fructosamine management for those taking 2000mg day of bitter melon. as published by study bitter melon had modest hypoglycemic effect and significantly reduced fructosamine levels from baseline among patients with type 2 diabetes who received 2.000 mg day. however hypoglycemic effect of bitter melon was less than metformin 1.000 mg day.[3 another study published in 2008 in international journal chemistry and biology indicated that compounds in bitter melon improved glycemic control helped cells uptake glucose and improved overall glucose tolerance. this study was done in mice and led to promising advancements in treating diabetes and obesity with bitter melon.[4 in contrast study published in journal of clinical epidemiology in 2007 did not show significant benefit of treatment of diabetes by bitter melon but 2 years later in british journal of nutrition it was stated that more better designed and clinical trials are required to confirm fruits role in diabetes treatment. since that 2007 study more studies have been done to show beneficial effects which perhaps was result of better design. when it comes to bitter melon juice current research available is showing strong results for specific types of cancer cell destruction diabetes treatment and potential prevention of pancreatic cancer. further research and clinical trials would be helpful to better understand how effective this plant can be and in what specific cases. it remains very promising option that could be explored under correct supervision. other uses of bitter melon bitter melon has been used as traditional medicine for long time. it has been used to treat colic fever burns chronic cough painful menstruation and

management veterans today military foreign affairs policy journal for clandestine services.,health editors note with type 1 diabetes body makes no natural insulin due to genetic issue or as has been found autoimmune reaction. this can happen during childhood and after. body uses insulin to place sugar glucose into body cells. body cells need sugar to properly function. difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is that as formerly mentioned in type 1 body produces no insulin and needs total replacement or supplementation of insulin. type 1 is like key is lost to lock in cell that lets glucose into cell. with type 2 diabetes pancreas makes insulin but body no longer recognizes insulin as if lock has been changed and key no longer works. high levels of glucose in body over time causes many problems such as hearing loss skin infections vision problems kidney failure neuropathy gum disease sex difficulties high blood pressure amputation and more. it is of utmost importance for body to have correct amount of glucose at all times to avoid above issues. optimal result would be for insulin to be administered as it is needed such has after meal. negative issues are caused with blood glucose levels are out of control with abnormal highs over periods of time. functioning pancreas will release insulin as blood glucose level increases after meal is ingested. diabetics must check their blood glucose levels after meals at bedtime after excessive exercising or at any time body will have or need increase in glucose levels. this testing is done by sticking finger and getting drop of blood to test for glucose level. to use unit artificial pancreas to decide when insulin should be administered day or night without finger stick would make diabetics life more normal and keep his or her health optimal due to fact that glucose levels should remain where they should be. in essence artificial pancreas will simulate healthy pancreas .. carol diabetes is disease that happens when your blood glucose or blood sugar is too high. glucose is bodys main source of energy. insulin hormone made by pancreas tells bodys cells to take in glucose. if you have type 1 diabetes your body does nt make insulin and glucose builds up in your blood. over time high levels of blood glucose can cause serious health problems. people with diabetes must test their blood glucose regularly with fingerstick or use continuous glucose monitor. they take insulin when needed by giving themselves injections or using insulin pump. researchers have developed all in one diabetes management systems. these artificial pancreas systems track blood glucose levels using continuous glucose monitor calculate when insulin is needed and automatically deliver it using insulin pump. artificial pancreas systems do nt entirely eliminate need for patient input but substantially reduce level of effort. to test efficacy and safety of artificial pancreas team led by drs. sue a. brown and boris kovatchev at university of virginia and dr. roy w. beck at jaeb center for health research carried out six month study of control iq technology system from tandem diabetes care. they enrolled 168 people with type 1 diabetes. study was funded by nihs national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk. results were published online on october 16 2019 in new england journal of medicine. participants were randomly assigned to use either control iq artificial pancreas or sensor augmented pump sap therapy. sap uses continuous glucose monitor and insulin pump but still requires frequent input and decisions from user about when and how much insulin to administer. control iq system uses advanced computer algorithms to automatically adjust insulin doses based on glucose levels. people who used artificial pancreas system showed significant increase in amount of time their blood glucose levels stayed in target range of 70 to 180 mg dlfrom 61 at start of study to 71. this translated to additional 2.6 hours per day in range. in contrast control group remained unchanged at 59. artificial pancreas users also showed improvements in time spent with high and low blood glucose and other measurements related to diabetes control. no severe low blood sugar hypoglycemia events occurred in either group. diabetic ketoacidosisa life threatening complicationoccurred in one participant in artificial pancreas group due to issue with insulin pump setup called pump infusion set failure. this artificial pancreas system has several unique features that improve glucose control beyond what is achievable using traditional methods says kovatchev. in particular there is special safety module dedicated to prevention of hypoglycemia and there is gradually intensified control overnight to achieve near normal blood sugar levels every morning. artificial pancreas technology has tremendous potential to improve day to day lives of people with type 1 diabetes says niddk director dr. griffin p. rodgers. by making management of type 1 diabetes easier and more precise this technology could reduce daily burden of this disease while also potentially reducing diabetes complications including eye nerve and kidney diseases.,

diabetes part. 1 how to make insulin prepper before it 's news.,preparedness for people with diabetes part. 1 how to make insulin its not easy to live with diabetes especially when you are insulin dependent. even now under normal circumstances when you have almost unlimited access to medical services and medication. think about how radically your life will change when shtf. in collapsed society knowing how to make insulin can make difference between life and death. type 1 diabetes is tricky disease that requires special diet and constant medication i.e. insulin. in disaster scenario diabetic person is very vulnerable way more vulnerable than regular joe because insulin dependency is yet another thing that must be taken care of besides regular survival needs such as food water and shelter. when you have diabetes you re playing perpetual chess game with your body. type 1 diabetics besides being insulin dependent are prone to various diseases infections and multitude of metabolic problems. knowing how to make insulin at home is like ultimate level when it comes to preparedness. but before getting there lets make few notes about how person with diabetes should prepare for worst case scenario. first thing you should stockpile lots of testing strips and syringes. these are pretty cheap hence making serious stockpile would present no significant problem. in case you ll need them you ll see that they are more valuable than money gold diamonds ammo or whatever. another thing to stockpile is obviously insulin. but keep in mind that stockpile of insulin if stored properly temperature must not exceed 84f refrigeration is nt must have has shelf life of just few months even days. keep in mind that expired insulin will kill you expired insulin forms crystals that are lethal when injected. how to tell when insulin goes bad do nt use bottled insulin past expiration date printed on label. and no matter what expiration date is throw away bottle one month after you open it. to help you keep track write date that you opened bottle on bottles label. there are two ways to tell when insulin is no longer good poor performance and unusual appearance. if your blood sugar stays high even though you re following your treatment plan your insulin may have lost its effectiveness. 1. poor performance could be due to two things insulin bottle has been open for more than 28 days. there are lot of punctures in rubber stopper because you take very small doses of insulin and you re getting close to end of bottle. 2. if your insulin has unusual appearance insulin is cloudy when it is supposed to be clear. insulin is supposed to be cloudy but it has clumps even after rolling it between your palms. insulin looks stringy. insulin has changed in color. diet diabetes veggiesdiet is another crucial thing to consider. human body needs insulin to break down carbohydrates. so low carb protein rich diet will keep your insulin dependency little bit under control. but of course you probably know that. if you re on protein rich diet you should drink lots of water and prevent your blood from becoming too acidic ketones are culprit in this case for diabetic in survival mode by ingesting solution of sodium bicarbonate baking soda cheap and excellent for lots of uses. baking soda alkalizes body opposite of acidification. your diet must be very strict just enough to maintain your weight and must consist of lots of small meals during day protein rich meals and as little carbs as possible. you must be moderately active given limited caloric intake and avoid heavy duty activities that can drain your body of energy. you must keep eye on symptoms of hyper hypoglycemia hence monitoring your blood sugar must be high on your priority list. these symptoms include sweating hunger dizziness fatigue erratic heartbeat confusion and in extreme cases even loss of consciousness. there is so much to say about this subject. few months ago friend of mine with type 2 diabetes succeeded in overcoming his disease with proper program including very specific diet. he is writing book together with his doctor about it. he promised book will be posted on this website. how to make insulin when shtf now lets get back to our main problem how to make insulin in long term survival scenario. i must warn you this is not simple task. its actually very complicated and you ll need access to some equipment. actually i think you ll also need degree in chemistry just to make sense of lecture i will give you little later. most important thing when shtf is to help your body make insulin by providing it with proper diet and with little help from over counter medication such as metformin berberine novonorm go for highest dosage available. these are different types of oral medication for diabetics that canreplace insulin by counteracting your bodys insulin resistance. they have very long shelf life by way so you can easily store them. in this way even small quantities of insulin that your body produces will have significant impact when it comes to lowering your blood sugar levels. now if you want to know how to make insulin at home you should go back to basics i.e. to read lecture about how first batch of insulin was created in lab almost 100 years ago actually in 1922 and scientists got nobel prize for that. as i already told you and i must emphasize knowing how to make insulin at home is not enough. you ll need to have access to lots of stuff such as pancreatic organs of cows or pigs power very unlikely in shtf scenario in order to use centrifuges and lab equipment not to mention very solid chemistry knowledge. truth be told it is highly improbable that you ll manage to make insulin at home to put together all chemicals and all equipment in disaster scenario but who knows maybe you can do it hence let me show you actual transcript of lecture from 1920s given by insulin inventors themselves describing process. present method of preparation is as follows. beef or pork pancreas is finely minced in larger grinder and minced material is then treated with 5 c.c. of concentrated sulphuric acid appropriately diluted per pound of glands. mixture is stirred for period of three or four hours and 95 alcohol is added until concentration of alcohol is 60 to 70. two extractions of glands are made. solid material is then partially removed by centrifuging mixture and solution is further clarified by filtering through paper. filtrate is practically neutralized with sodium hydroxide. clear filtrate is concentrated in vacuo to about 1/15 of its original volume. concentrate is then heated to 50o degrees centigrade which results in separation of lipoid and other materials which are removed by filtration. ammonium sulphate 37 grams. per 100 c.c. is then added to concentrate and protein material containing all insulin floats to top of liquid. precipitate is skimmed off and dissolved in hot acid alcohol. when precipitate has completely dissolved 10 volumes of warm alcohol are added. solution is then neutralized with naoh and cooled to room temperature and kept in refrigerator at 5oc for two days. at end of this time dark coloured supernatant alcohol is decanted off. alcohol contains practically no potency. precipitate is dried in vacuo to remove all trace of alcohol. it is then dissolved in acid water in which it is readily soluble. solution is made alkaline with naoh to ph 7.3 to 7.5. at this alkalinity dark coloured precipitate settles out and is immediately centrifuged off. this precipitate is washed once or twice with alkaline water of ph 9.0 and washings are added to main liquid. it is important that this process be carried out fairly quickly as insulin is destroyed in alkaline solution. acidity is adjusted to ph 5.0 and white precipitate readily settles out. tricresol is added to concentration of 0.3 in order to assist in isoelectric precipitation and to act as preservative. after standing one week in ice chest supernatant liquid is decanted off and resultant liquid is removed by centrifuging. precipitate is then dissolved in small quantity of acid water. second isoelectric precipitation is carried out by adjusting acidity to ph of approximately 5.0. after standing over night resultant precipitate is removed by centrifuging. precipitate which contains active principle in comparatively pure form is dissolved in acid water and hydrogen ion concentration adjusted to ph 2.5. material is carefully tested to determine potency and is then diluted to desired strength of 10 20 40 or 80 units per c.c. tricresol is added to secure concentration of 0.1 percent. sufficient sodium chloride is added to make solution isotonic. insulin solution is passed through mandler filter. after passing through filter insulin is retested carefully to determine its potency. there is practically no loss in berkefelding. tested insulin is poured into sterile glass vials with aseptic precautions and sterility of final product thoroughly tested by approved methods. backyard innovator self sustaining source of fresh meat vegetables and clean drinking water conquering coming collapse financial

obesity and diabetes. ,practice of intermittent fasting during which you restrict calories for several hours or days has positive effect on metabolic flexibility reducing your risk of diabetes. consider one of several ways to incorporate this practice in your routine factors affecting your risk of diabetes include obesity high blood pressure lack of physical activity depression and history of heart disease or stroke. additionally low levels of vitamin d and magnesium are associated with higher risk of diabetes researchers have discovered unique fat molecule in avocados avocatin b avob which demonstrates positive effect on reducing insulin resistance by assisting body in complete oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. results were positive in animal study and human subjects avocados may help with weight management and blood sugar control reducing your risk of obesity and diabetes. avocados help you feel full longer are packed with fiber and are high in amounts of several essential vitamins and minerals including b vitamins potassium and vitamin k avocados are rich in monounsaturated fat your body burns easily for energy. they may be one of healthiest foods you can eat every day as they help protect your heart and optimize your cholesterol. they also are rich in fiber. together with high amounts of several essential vitamins and minerals including b vitamins potassium and vitamin k avocado is fruit you may want to consider for more than guacamole. adding avocados to salad also helps your body to absorb three to five times more carotenoids helping your body fight against free radical damage. average sized avocado also contains about 10 of recommended daily value of magnesium mineral used by every organ in your body. insufficient levels may lead to unexplained muscle fatigue or weakness abnormal heart rhythms or muscle spasms. avocados are also surprisingly high in fiber which plays important role in digestive heart and skin health. fiber is also important in helping to regulate blood sugar and weight management. one study found eating one half of fresh avocado with lunch may help you feel full longer and prevent snacking later. avocados do n't ripen on tree but only after they 're picked. choose firm avocados as they will keep in refrigerator for couple of weeks ripening slowly. on your counter they will ripen within few days. after you cut it avocado will turn brown from oxidation. if you do n't eat it all you can keep it fresh longer by leaving pit with avocado and storing it in airtight container. brush lemon juice and olive oil over cut flesh to help inhibit oxidation. be aware though that oil can add oiliness to texture while juice will give it slight lemon flavor. avocados at breakfast may reduce hunger through day being overweight increases risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and it 's possible that eating avocados may help address these conditions. when it comes to weight management some ethnic groups may be more prone to developing both prediabetes and type 1 diabetes for example hispanic latino americans according to centers for disease control and prevention.1 although this is diverse group that includes people of cuban mexican puerto rican and south and central american they all have higher potential risk of developing diabetes than nonhispanic whites cdc says. increased risk may come from general risk factors including genetics foods you eat your weight and your activity levels. to gain insight into how to affect change one survey of hispanic millennials showed that they would be interested in learning about lifestyle changes they could make that could reduce their risk for diabetes without medication.2 investigation was spearheaded by hass avocado board which runs saborea uno hoy self described research program3 that promotes avocados for their health benefits. clinical study published in nutrients4 sought to evaluate how well avocados could satisfy hunger and replace carbohydrates in meal. using 31 overweight or obese adults researchers used visual analog scale that matched against serum levels of ghrelin hormone associated with appetite to measure how full participants felt after consuming one of three different meals. there was greater suppression of hunger after participants consumed whole avocado as compared to control meal high in carbohydrates and low in fat. they also felt more satisfied after meal with half or whole avocado as compared to control meal. researchers wrote replacing carbohydrates in high carbohydrate meal with avocado derived fat fiber combination increased feelings of satiety although study size was small findings support growing body of research that eating healthy fats including those found in avocados has positive impact on weight management and glucose control. fat found only in avocado associated with glycemic control another intriguing study found that avocados have yet another impact on glucose control and management of diabetes.5 researchers from university of guelph in ontario canada discovered fat molecule found only in avocados avocatin b avob has positive effect on reducing insulin resistance.6 researchers wrote diabetic 's inability to properly utilize blood glucose is associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. when body completely oxidizes fatty acid body can use fat for fuel. however obesity and diabetes inhibit body 's ability to completely oxidize fatty acids. avob counters this incomplete oxidation in pancreas and skeletal muscles improving insulin sensitivity. as detailed by science daily scientists fed mice fed high calorie meals for eight weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. then in following five weeks they added avob to diet of half group. at end of study treated animals weighed less than those in control group demonstrating slower weight gain during intervention and exhibiting improved insulin sensitivity. researchers also engaged human subjects and found avob supplement was absorbed safely without affecting kidney or liver function. human subjects also enjoyed weight reduction while eating typical western diet. beneficial effects of consuming monounsaturated fats from avocados shown in recent studies support past research7 comparing diet rich in complex carbohydrates against one rich in oleic acid from avocado and olive oil. data revealed replacing complex digestible carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in those with noninsulin dependent diabetes improved participants lipid profile while maintaining glycemic control. certain lifestyle choices may increase risk of diabetes in 2015 9.4 of u.s. population had been diagnosed with diabetes.8 this is slightly higher than 8.5 of global prevalence among adults over 18 years of age recorded by world health organization9 in 2014. your potential risk of developing type 2 diabetes is dependent on your lifestyle choices and genetics. while you ca n't change your genes there are certain risk factors over which you have control that can affect your chances of getting diabetes including:10 in addition to these risk factors low levels of vitamin d also affect your risk for developing metabolic syndrome characterized by high triglycerides low levels of high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol large waist circumference high blood pressure and high blood sugar and/or insulin resistance. vitamin d is steroid hormone responsible for influencing virtually every cell in your body. studies have found those who have lower levels of vitamin d have greater risk of developing metabolic syndrome. low levels of magnesium also contribute to development of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. one review found magnesium deficiency may be greatest predictor of heart disease and that even subclinical deficiency may compromise your cardiovascular health. studies have found those who have type 2 diabetes are more prone to magnesium deficiency depletion has been found in 75 with poorly controlled disease. in addition magnesium plays important role in regulation of high blood pressure another risk factor for type 2 diabetes. studies have also demonstrated supplementation may lower your risk and improve your condition if you currently have diabetes. you can boost your magnesium by eating foods rich in magnesium using epsom salt baths or taking oral supplement. my personal preference is magnesium threonate since it appears to be efficient at penetrating cell membranes including mitochondria and blood brain barrier. when your body is resistant to insulin it lowers cells ability to use glucose for energy. in response pancreas secretes more insulin to overcome cells weak response and maintain blood glucose in healthy range. additionally animal studies have demonstrated that repeated fasting may induce pancreatic beta cell growth accompanied by marked improvement in blood sugar control. in one animal study researchers found pancreatic fat plays role in development of type 2 diabetes but intermittent fasting helps prevent these fatty deposits. team found mice undergoing intermittent fasting every other day exhibited better glucose control and less fat in liver and pancreas than control group that was allowed unlimited food. intermittent fasting encourages your body to burn fat for fuel. by not relying exclusively on carbohydrates it reduces insulin resistance that can develop in tissues and organs. your skeletal muscle burns 60 to 80 of glucose thought to be related to interaction of skeletal muscle and insulin resistance in those with type 2 diabetes. overall metabolic inflexibility may be overridden by fasting and improving mitochondrial capacity. in other words ability to use both fat and carbohydrates for fuel is necessary to reduce insulin resistance maintain weight and achieve optimal health. what is intermittent fasting and how do you practice it. there are several ways to integrate intermittent fasting. idea is to forgo food for specific amount of time. method you choose will vary by number of days hours and calories you allow. there is no one plan that works for everyone so it 's likely you 'll find way to fit it into your lifestyle preferences to improve your metabolic flexibility. i recommend starting with 12-hour fast from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. once you have achieved this for week try adding one hour every week for month. this will help you easily move from 12-hour daily fast to 16-hour daily fast. before starting remember intermittent fasting is not necessarily form of calorie restriction but rather eliminating food sources to improve metabolic flexibility. sugar and hunger cravings will disappear as your body begins burning fat so quality of your diet does play important role in your health. reduce or eliminate as much processed food as possible and practice fasting under your physician 's care if you have underlying medical condition. here are several different ways of incorporating intermittent fasting into your daily routine 12-hours day fast this is often used as jumping off point as described above. 16-hours day fast this is sometimes referred to as 16/8 method and is graduation from 12-hour fast. many people choose to finish eating by 7 p.m. and do not eat again until noon. two days week for some it may be easier to restrict food for 24 hours twice weekly as opposed to each day. men may eat up to 600 calories on fasting days and women up to 500 calories. to use this type of intermittent fasting successfully there should be at least one nonfasting day between your fasting days. every other day there are several variations of every other day plan. some completely avoid solid food and others allow up to 500 calories on fasting days. authors of one study found this type of intermittent fasting was effective for weight loss and heart health for both normal and overweight adults. meal skipping this is more flexible approach that works well for those who respond to hunger signals and normally eat when they 're hungry and skip meals when they 're not.,avocados may help with weight management and blood

health before it 's news.,short stroll after meals better for blood sugar than walks at other times says daily telegraph. story is based on study which aimed to see whether taking 10-minute walk after main meal resulted in lower blood glucose levels than single 30-minute walk each day for people with type 2 diabetes. study which involved 41 adults found that taking shorter more frequent walks immediately after meals reduced blood glucose by around 12 compared with single 30-minute walk. greatest benefit was seen after evening meal when carbohydrate consumption was high and participants tended to be less active. researchers did not explain why post meal walk was more effective at lowering glucose in blood. however they believe short stroll after every meal could reduce need for insulin injections which can help people better manage their weight. researchers say current physical activity guidelines should be changed to specifically include post meal activity especially after meals with lots of carbohydrate such as bread rice potatoes and pasta. there are 4 million people living with diabetes in uk and 90 of those have type 2 diabetes according to diabetes uk. type 2 diabetes occurs when body does nt produce enough insulin to function properly or bodys cells do nt react to insulin. due to short duration of this study we ca nt be sure that effect seen in this research would last and lead to overall improvement in blood glucose levels and diabetes control. however findings are interesting and if confirmed by further research could mean this simple lifestyle change would benefit people with diabetes. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from university of otago in new zealand. it was supported by grants from university of otago and new zealand artificial limb service. glycated albumin reagents were provided by asahi kasei. study was published in peer reviewed medical journal diabetologia. reporting of study by media was broadly accurate. but as study was carried out in people with diabetes it is perhaps misleading to say that it cuts risk as suggested in daily express. what kind of research was this. this was randomised crossover study which aimed to assess whether timing of walking in relation to meals could benefit people with diabetes by reducing their blood sugar levels. this study design is good way of testing for such benefits as participants act as their own controls and are randomly assigned to intervention groups. in theory this should balance out any differences in characteristics and potential confounders between participants meaning effect seen is due to intervention rather than influence of other factors. as physical activity lowers blood glucose levels its important for people with diabetes to exercise regularly. current advice is to do 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity week such as cycling or fast walking. this study attempted to examine whether taking 10 minute bursts of exercise after each main meal proved to be of greater benefit than single 30 minute stretch. what did research involve. adults aged 18 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes were included in study. recruitment was from general practices hospital outpatient clinics local diabetes society and services for people with chronic diseases. those who were pregnant breastfeeding and unable or unwilling to comply with required physical activity were not included. participants were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups each intervention lasted 14 days followed by 30 day break. participants then crossed over to intervention they had not yet received. two interventions were activity information including walking and sitting time and other sedentary behaviours was collected using exercise monitor device worn during waking hours for 14 days of study. main outcome was level of glucose in blood after meal postprandial glycaemia which was assessed during three hours after meal. on days 1 7 and 14 of each intervention participants visited clinic for following assessments day 1 fasting blood sample was drawn body measurements were taken physical activity regimen was prescribed and exercise monitors were fitted. day 7 participants were fitted with continuous glucose monitoring system and given portable glucometer. seven day food diary was started. day 14 fasting blood sample was drawn body measurements were taken glucose and exercise monitors were removed and food diary was returned. same set of procedures was followed with both interventions. what were basic results. researchers included 41 adults with average age of 60 years who had diabetes for average of 10 years. study found that when participants walked after meals level of blood glucose was 12 lower than in those who went for single walk each day. improvement was greatest after evening meal 22 when carbohydrate consumption was generally highest. this is also time of day when people were most likely to be active. there were no side effects related to two different approaches. one person died during 30-day break but this was not related to trial. how did researchers interpret results. researchers concluded that post meal physical activity may avoid need for increased total insulin dose or additional mealtime insulin injections that might otherwise have been prescribed to lower glucose levels after eating. benefits relating to physical activity following meals suggest that current guidelines should be amended to specify post meal activity particularly when meals contain substantial amount of carbohydrate. this randomised controlled crossover trial aimed to assess whether taking 10 minute walk after each main meal provides additional benefit in lowering blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes compared with single 30 minute daily walk. study found that taking shorter more frequent walks after meals produced lower blood sugar estimates than single walk. researchers believe that based on these findings current guidelines should be changed and specify post meal activity especially if meal is high in carbohydrate. this study was well designed and made efforts to reduce risk of chance findings. limitation of this study is short duration. we ca nt be sure if benefits of post meal walk are long term and we do nt know if differences in blood glucose seen about 0.5mmol l lower would make meaningful difference in terms of these peoples diabetes control. participants were not monitored during trial break so we do not know what their diet and exercise habits were during this time and this may have had impact on overall findings. we also do not know if this exercise routine would reduce risk of diabetes in people who do nt have diabetes or those with pre diabetes. researchers did not explain why post meal walk was more effective at lowering glucose in blood. however they believe short stroll after every meal could reduce need for insulin injections which can help people with diabetes to better manage their weight. findings of this research are certainly interesting and if they are confirmed to be accurate by further research it would mean this simple lifestyle change would benefit people with diabetes. taking stroll after meals can tackle diabetes patients who took ten minute walk after eating had lower blood sugar

problem. there are two main types of diabetes- type 1 diabetes in which body does not produce insulin and type 2 diabetes in which body does not produce enough insulin or insulin that is produced does not work properly. some of common symptoms of diabetes include fatigue weight loss even though you are eating more excessive thirst increased urination cut and bruises that are slow to heal and blurred vision. while there is no cure for diabetes with your blood sugar level under control you can live totally normal life. there are various natural remedies for diabetes that will help you control your blood sugar level. here are top 10 home remedies for diabetes. needless to say you also need to consult doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment. bitter gourd also known as bitter melon can be helpful for controlling diabetes due to its blood glucose lowering effects. it tends to influence glucose metabolism all over your body rather than particular organ or tissue. it helps increase pancreatic insulin secretion and prevents insulin resistance. thus bitter gourd is beneficial for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. however it can not be used to entirely replace insulin treatment. drink some bitter gourd juice on empty stomach each morning. first remove seeds of two to three bitter gourds and use juicer to extract juice. add some water and then drink it. follow this treatment daily in morning for at least two months. also you can include one dish made of bitter gourd daily in your diet. powdered cinnamon has ability to lower blood sugar levels by stimulating insulin activity. it contains bioactive components that can help prevent and fight diabetes. certain trials have shown that it can work as effective option to lower blood sugar levels in cases of uncontrolled type-2 diabetes. cinnamon however should not be taken in excess because we commonly use cassia cinnamon found in most grocery stores which contains compound called coumarin. it is toxic compound that increases risk of liver damage. there is another variety of this herb known as ceylon cinnamon or true cinnamon. it is considered safer for health but its effects on blood glucose levels have not been studied adequately. mix one half to one teaspoon of cinnamon in cup of warm water. drink it daily. another option is to boil two to four cinnamon sticks in one cup of water and allow it to steep for 20 minutes. drink this solution daily until you see improvement. you can also add cinnamon to warm beverages smoothies and baked goods. fenugreek is herb that can also be used to control diabetes improve glucose tolerance and lower blood sugar levels due to its hypoglycaemic activity. it also stimulates secretion of glucose dependent insulin. being high in fiber it slows down absorption of carbohydrates and sugars. soak two tablespoons of fenugreek seeds in water overnight. drink water along with seeds in morning on empty stomach. follow this remedy without fail for few months to bring down your glucose level. another option is to eat two tablespoons of powdered fenugreek seeds daily with milk. indian gooseberry also known as amla is rich in vitamin c and indian gooseberry juice promotes proper functioning of your pancreas. take two to three indian gooseberries remove seeds and grind it into fine paste. put paste in cloth and squeeze out juice. mix two tablespoon of juice in one cup of water and drink it daily on empty stomach. alternatively mix one tablespoon of indian gooseberry juice in cup of bitter gourd juice and drink it daily for few months. black plum or jambul also known as jamun can help lot in controlling blood sugar level because it contains anthocyanins ellagic acid hydrolysable tannins etc. each part of jambul plant such as leaves berry and seeds can be used by those suffering from diabetes. in fact research has shown that fruits and seeds of this plant have hypoglycemic effects as they help reduce blood and urine sugar levels rapidly. seeds in particular contain glycoside jamboline and alkaloid jambosine that regulate control blood sugar levels. whenever this seasonal fruit is available in market try to include it in your diet as it can be very effective for pancreas. else you can make powder of dried seeds of jambul fruit and eat this powder with water twice day. this fruit is native to india and its neighboring countries but you can find it at asian markets and herbal shops. delicate and tender mango leaves can be used to treat diabetes by regulating insulin levels in blood. they can also help improve blood lipid profiles. soak 10 to 15 tender mango leaves in glass of water overnight. in morning filter water and drink it on empty stomach. you can also dry leaves in shade and grind them. eat one half teaspoon of powdered mango leaves two times daily. curry leaves are useful in preventing and controlling diabetes as they have anti diabetic properties. it is believed that curry leaves contain ingredient that reduces rate at which starch is broken down to glucose in diabetics. so you can simply chew about 10 fresh curry leaves daily in morning. for best results continue this treatment for three to four months. it also helps reduce high cholesterol levels and obesity. aloe vera gel helps lower fasting blood glucose levels. it contains phytosterols that have possible anti hyperglycemic effects for type 2 diabetes. combination of aloe vera gel bay leaves and turmeric is helpful for controlling blood sugar. to make this herbal medicine mix together one half teaspoon each of ground bay leaves and turmeric and one tablespoon of aloe vera gel. consume it twice daily before lunch and dinner. due to its vitamin c and high fiber content eating guava can be really helpful in maintaining blood sugar level. it is best for diabetics not to eat skin of fruit so peel it first. however too much consumption of guava in day is not recommended. okra also called ladies finger has constituents such as polyphenolic molecules that can help reduce blood glucose levels and control diabetes. 2011 study published in journal of pharmacy and bioallied sciences found okra seed and peel powder to have antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic potential. cut off ends of few okras and prick them in several places using fork. soak okras in glass of water overnight. in morning discard okras and drink water on empty stomach. do this daily for several weeks. also include okra in your diet. get plenty of fiber in your diet. few minutes of daily exposure to sunlight can also help control diabetes because it helps produce vitamin d which is essential for insulin production. drink plenty of water throughout day. in fact replace your regular sodas and sugary juices with water. in addition to providing hydration water helps break down sugars. try deep breathing meditation listening to your favorite music or working on your hobby to relieve stress as it may raise your blood sugar.,your alternative

unproven health before it 's news. ,diets laden with butter cream and cheese can help combat surge in type 2 diabetes mail online reports. but study it reports on only followed small group of men for 12 weeks not long enough to determine whether diet would prevent diabetes or other chronic diseases. study involved 38 overweight to obese men randomised to one of two strictly controlled diets containing same amount of calories which body burns to create energy. in first group energy mainly came from carbohydrates 53 of total calorie intake while energy mainly came from fats 73 of total calorie intake in second group. men in both groups lost weight and body fat after 12 weeks on diets. there were only minor differences in certain blood sugar and cholesterol markers nothing you could draw any conclusions from. main problem with this trial is it is so small and it looked only at short term effects. you ca nt conclude anything from these results about longer term effects diet would have on diabetes and cardiovascular disease. important fact not mentioned in reporting of study is both of diets involved eating fewer calories than men had previously consumed. this reinforces fact there is no magic bullet to weight loss simply eat less and move more. study certainly does nt give green light to eating as much fat as you like. but healthy unsaturated fats should be included as part of balanced diet. where did story come from. study was carried out by researchers from university of bergen in norway and was published in peer reviewed american journal of clinical nutrition. it was funded by western norway regional health authority meltzerfondet bergen medical research foundation and university of bergen. several companies provided products used in study. mail onlines reporting of study was poor. in final paragraph of study researchers warn about trying to extrapolate their short term results to longer term effects on metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. yet this is precisely what mail has done. its very difficult to see how mail concluded high fat diet can combat surge in type 2 diabetes. reduction in fasting blood sugar was in fact seen in low fat group not high fat one. and even then there was little difference seen between groups for other markers study categorically did not find one of these diets was better than other. what kind of research was this. this randomised controlled trial rct aimed to investigate theory that consuming fats or carbohydrates would have different effects on amount of fat around body organs and on markers of metabolic syndrome. metabolic syndrome is collection of signs and symptoms high blood pressure high cholesterol poor blood sugar control and obesity that put person at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. its thought different dietary components could make some people more likely to develop syndrome. randomised controlled trial is best way of investigating effects of intervention. but difficulty with randomised controlled trial assessing diet is that because of practicalities of running trials they often include small numbers of people assessed on short term basis. this means results of such studies ca nt lead to sweeping conclusions on population level. what did researchers do. trial recruited 46 overweight to obese men aged 30 to 50 with body mass index bmi over 29 via newspaper advertisement. researchers excluded men with serious illness and those taking regular medication or who had recently been trying to lose weight. men were randomised to follow 12 weeks of one of two diets very high fat low carbohydrate vhflc diet with 73 of energy from fat and 10 from carbohydrate low fat high carbohydrate lfhc diet with 30 of energy from fat and 53 from carbohydrate two diets provided identical daily energy intake 8.750 kj day with 17 from protein. both diets followed low glycaemic index gi pattern meaning they would nt cause rapid rise in blood glucose levels after eating. both groups were told to consume more than 500 g of fruit and vegetables day and eat fish twice week and were given standardised supplies of butter coconut oil and sugar substitutes. each group was also given recipe booklets for their specific diet and attended course prior to trial to ensure they understood diet. each month men were asked to keep five day food records and weigh out their food on daily basis. men were asked to keep their physical activity same were questioned about their ability to follow diet strictly and told about importance of accuracy and honesty during trial. researchers analysed blood samples to look at fat levels and blood sugar examined mens respiratory function and used ct scanners to assess body composition. what did they find. after various drop outs only 38 of original 46 men were available for analysis just 18 in lfhc group and 20 in vhflc group. body weight dropped by about 11 12 kg or 3.6 bmi points in both groups over 12-week period. total abdominal fat and fat around organs decreased by roughly 20 30 in both groups. waist circumference decreased by 11 13 cm. there were no significant differences between groups. fasting blood sugar only reduced in lfhc group but there were no other between group differences for other measures of blood sugar control such as insulin. levels of one type of fat triglycerides decreased in both groups. low density bad cholesterol decreased only in lfhc group but high density good cholesterol increased only in vhflc group. improvements were noted to occur within first eight weeks in vhflc group but were more gradual in lfhc group. what did researchers conclude. researchers concluded that consuming energy primarily as carbohydrate or fat for three months did not differentially influence organ fat and metabolic syndrome in low processed lower glycaemic dietary context. our data do not support idea that dietary fat per se promotes body fat and cardiometabolic syndrome in humans. this small trial aimed to see whether there is difference between strictly controlled low gi diets that contain same amount of energy but are either predominantly fat or carbohydrate based. overall researchers found diets caused both weight and fat reduction with little difference between two with exception of minor differences in certain blood sugar and cholesterol markers significance of which is difficult to interpret. these could just be down to chance. researchers were careful to control diets and other lifestyle aspects to try to ensure any observed effects were only coming from diets. however trial had couple of important limitations. for one it was very small to start with even before losing extra eight to follow up. as researchers acknowledged study may not have had sufficient numbers to reliably detect differences in outcomes between groups. groups also included specific group of overweight to obese men so effects in these people may not be comparable with other populations. most importantly short term measures of weight blood sugar and body fat at three months tell you nothing about possible longer term effects. this means you ca nt conclude anything about persons risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease in longer term. little can be concluded from this relatively brief small study. it certainly does nt change our current understanding about diet and health. best way to lose weight or maintain normal weight and reduce your risk of disease is to follow current healthy eating and exercise guidelines. you should aim to eat balanced amounts of carbohydrate protein and fat. fat is good for you. diets laden with butter cream and cheese can help combat surge in type 2 diabetes. mail online december 11 2016 veum vl laupsa borge j eng et al.

high blood pressure lewrockwell. ,magnesium1 is involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions in your body.2.3 and deficiency can contribute to significant health problems. two common pathologies associated with magnesium deficiency are type 2 diabetes4.5 and heart disease. according to one scientific review.6 low magnesium may actually be greatest predictor of heart disease and other recent research7 published in open heart journal suggests even subclinical magnesium deficiency can compromise your cardiovascular health. as noted in 2018 scientific review8.9 published in open heart journal vast majority of people in modern societies are at risk for magnesium deficiency due to chronic diseases medications decreases in food crop magnesium contents and availability of refined and processed foods. according to this review most fail to meet recommended daily allowance rda for magnesium 48 of americans do not get sufficient magnesium from their diet. among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis rate of magnesium deficiency is 84%.10 type 2 diabetics also tend to be more prone to magnesium deficiency and magnesium depletion has been found in 75 of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes review states.11 ketofast rejuvenate y ... joseph mercola check amazon for pricing. low magnesium has been linked to higher risk for high blood pressure.12 stroke13 and sudden cardiac death.14 according to open heart study authors.15 most people need additional 300 mg of magnesium per day in order to lower their risk of developing numerous chronic diseases and this includes heart disease and diabetes. magnesium supports healthy heart function and helps prevent heart disease by:16 combating inflammation thereby helping prevent hardening of your arteries improving blood flow by relaxing your arteries and preventing your blood from thickening allowing it to flow more smoothly magnesium also plays important role in diabetes and this is not nearly as recognized as it needs to be. low magnesium levels have been linked to higher risk of insulin resistance precursor to type 2 diabetes.17 as it impairs your bodys ability to regulate blood sugar which is important for prevention of type 2 diabetes.18.19.20.21 in one study.22 prediabetics with highest magnesium intake reduced their risk for blood sugar and metabolic problems by 71 compared to those with lowest intake. high levels of insulin in blood common with insulin resistance also lead to further loss of magnesium.23 most recently study24 published in october 2019 in online issue of diabetes research and clinical practice again linked low magnesium levels with both diabetes and high blood pressure both of which are risk factors for heart disease. as reported by authors:25 earlier meta analysis.26 published in 2007 also found that magnesium intake was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes incidence. this analysis included seven cohort studies looking at magnesium from either food or diet and supplements combined. according to authors magnesium supplementation not only can lower your risk of type 2 diabetes but also has been shown to improve your condition if you already have full blown diabetes. this was demonstrated in 2018 study27 in journal nutrients. type 2 diabetics who took 250 milligrams mg of magnesium per day for three months saw significant improvement in insulin levels and hba1c hemoglobin a1c which is marker of long term glucose control compared to controls. as noted by authors.28 results of this study matched previous studies that concluded that daily oral mg supplementation substantially improved insulin sensitivity by 10 and reduced blood sugar by 37. are you deficient in magnesium. best way to ascertain your magnesium status is to do rbc magnesium test which measures amount of magnesium in your red blood cells along with tracking any signs and symptoms of magnesium deficiency such as:29.30 seizures muscle spasms especially charley horses or spasms in your calf muscle that happen when you stretch your leg and/or eye twitches numbness or tingling in your extremities trousseau sign31 to check for this sign blood pressure cuff is inflated around your arm. pressure should be greater than your systolic blood pressure and maintained for three minutes. by occluding brachial artery in your arm spasms in your hand and forearm muscles are induced. if you are magnesium deficient lack of blood flow will cause your wrist and metacarpophalangeal joint to flex and your fingers to adduct illustrated in video below. more exhaustive list can be found in dr. carolyn deans blog post gauging magnesium deficiency symptoms.32 which will give you checklist to go through every few weeks. this will also help you gauge how much magnesium you need to resolve your deficiency symptoms. grassrootshealth which is conducting consumer sponsored research into vitamin d and omega-3 has now added magnesium to its nutrient research. their vitamin d magnesium and omega 3 plus elements test kit is excellent and cost effective way to check status of several vital nutrients along with essential minerals selenium zinc and copper and harmful heavy metals cadmium lead and mercury. each kit contains instructions for how to collect your blood sample. you then mail in your sample and fill out quick online health questionnaire through grassrootshealth. your participation in this research project will enable grassrootshealth researchers to provide accurate data about magnesium status in population level at which disease prevention is actually obtained and guidance on dosing to achieve optimal levels. fat for fuel revolu ... joseph mercola check amazon for pricing. all of this is crucial information that can go long way toward improving public health. as explained by grassrootshealth questions about magnesium that this particular project aims to provide answers for include:33 what specific health outcomes are associated with this nutrient for me for total group. how can i figure out how much to take. what s dose response relationship for all. for me. does it matter if i m also taking vitamin d. omega-3. does it matter what compound of this nutrient i take. what time of day. how often. what are demonstrated health outcomes used to create this nutrients recommended range. your test results will be emailed to you in about 10 to 20 days after your samples are received. your health data are used anonymously. please note that 100 of proceeds from kits go to fund research project. i do not charge anything extra as distributor of these test kits. why most people need more magnesium one of reasons why magnesium insufficiency or deficiency is so common both among adults34 and teens.35 is in part due to fact that most people do nt eat enough plant foods. magnesium is actually part of chlorophyll molecule responsible for plants green color. if you frequently eat processed foods your risk of deficiency is magnified. that said even if you eat plenty of greens you might still need to take supplement as most foods are grown in mineral depleted soils and are thus much lower in magnesium than they have been historically. magnesium absorption is also dependent on having sufficient amounts of selenium parathyroid hormone and vitamins b6 and d and is hindered by excess ethanol salt coffee and phosphoric acid in soda. sweating stress lack of sleep excessive menstruation certain drugs especially diuretics and proton pump inhibitors also deplete your body of magnesium.36 for these reasons most people probably need to take supplemental magnesium. taking magnesium supplement is particularly advisable if you:37 recommended dietary allowance for magnesium is around 310 to 420 mg per day depending on your age and sex.41 but many experts believe you may need 600 to 900 mg per day.42 personally i believe many may benefit from amounts as high as 1 to 2 grams 1.000 to 2.000 mg of elemental magnesium per day as most of us have electromagnetic field exposures that simply can not be mitigated and extra magnesium may help lower damage from that exposure. if your veggie consumption is low to begin with consider including more magnesium rich vegetables in your daily diet. dark green leafy vegetables lead pack when it comes to magnesium content and juicing your greens is excellent way to boost your intake. other foods that are particularly rich in magnesium include natto raw cacao nibs unsweetened cocoa powder avocados pumpkin and sesame seeds and herbs like chives and basil.43 one way to check your daily magnesium intake from foods is to use free online nutritional tracker such as cronometer. other ways to boost your magnesium level if your magnesium intake from food is found lacking it would certainly be wise to supplement either orally or topically. for oral supplementation my personal preference is magnesium threonate as it appears to be most efficient at penetrating cell membranes including your mitochondria and blood brain barrier. as general rule i recommend starting out on dose of 200 mg of oral magnesium citrate per day gradually increasing your dose until you develop slightly loose stools. to use this method you need to use magnesium citrate as its known for having laxative effect. once you know your cutoff you can switch to other forms if you like. other effective ways to boost your magnesium level include taking epsom salt magnesium sulfate baths as magnesium will effectively absorb through your skin. using topical solution i prepare supersaturated solution of epsom salt by dissolving 7 tablespoons of salt into 6 ounces of water and heating it until all salt has dissolved. i pour it into dropper bottle and then apply it to my skin and rub fresh aloe leaves over it to dissolve it. this is easy and inexpensive way to increase your magnesium and will allow you to get higher dosages into your body without having to deal with its laxative effects. magnesium can be taken with or without food. if you re also taking calcium take them together. if you exercise regularly consider taking your calcium and magnesium in ratio of one part calcium to two parts magnesium with your pre workout meal. while ideal ratio of magnesium to calcium is thought to be 1-to-1 most people get far more calcium than magnesium from their diet hence your need for supplemental magnesium may be two to three times greater than calcium. best of joseph mercola.,

sweeteners and diabetes health before it 's news. ,naturalhealth365 according to american diabetes association diabetes has become pandemic affecting 30 million people in united states alone. unfortunately rate of diabetes continues to grow exponentially due to overconsumption of processed foods which dominate standard american diet or its more popular name sad. shockingly by 2030 who is predicting diabetes will become seventh leading cause of death around world. so what s main ingredient fueling this health crisis of metabolic disorders. look no further than consumption of artificial sweeteners under names like sweetn low nutrisweet equal aspartame list goes on and on. listen to experts artificial sweeteners are neurotoxic causing major health problems study at imperial college of london found that people who drink single 12-ounce soda day increased their risk of type-2 diabetes by 18 percent compared to those who avoided soda. study from harvard medical school and brigham and womens hospital in boston found that women who drink one soda per day double their risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to women who drink less than one soda per month. in addition if these quotes below do nt make you think twice about consuming artificial sweeteners then nothing will. unfortunately many patients in my practice and others seen in consultation developed serious metabolic neurologic and other complications that could be specifically attributed to using aspartame products. this was evidenced by loss of diabetic control intensification of hypoglycemia occurrence of presumed insulin reactions including convulsions that proved to be aspartame reactions and precipitation aggravation or simulation of diabetic complications especially impaired vision and neuropathy while using these products dramatic improvement of such features after avoiding aspartame and prompt predictable recurrence of these problems when patient resumed aspartame products knowingly or inadvertently. h.j.roberts m.d. f.a.c.p. f.c.c.p in view of all these indications that cancer causing potential of aspartame is matter that had been established way beyond any reasonable doubt one can ask what is reason for apparent refusal by fda to invoke for this food additive so called delaney amendment to food drug and cosmetic act. is it not clear beyond any shadow of doubt that aspartame has caused brain tumors or brain cancer in animals. dr. adrian gross former fda toxicologist so in case of diet drinks in aluminum cans very toxic brain aluminum fluoride compound co exists with multiple toxins found in aspartame thus creating most powerful government approved toxic soup imaginable. with strong association between aluminum excitotoxins aluminum fluoride complexes and alzheimers disease it would be completely irresponsible to encourage people to consume this toxic mixture. russell blaylock m.d. uninformed consumers in effort to reduce sugar intake and reduce risk of diabetes tend to think that artificial sweeteners offer some kind of safe alternative to processed sugar. but as we now know scientific evidence is abundantly clear consuming artificial sweeteners actually increase risk of obesity diabetes plus many other health problems. when researchers from weizmann institute of science in rehovot israel began studying effects of aspartame sucralose and other artificial sweeteners in body what they found was startling. data acquired through study revealed significant change within composition and function of good bacteria within intestines of mice fed steady measure of various non caloric artificial sweeteners. since these bacteria play important role in digestion and glucose metabolism threatening this balance of good and bad bacteria within gut by eating artificial sweeteners can lead to glucose intolerance over time. in addition to changing intestinal bacterial composition artificial sweeteners were also linked to higher blood sugar levels. people who regularly consume chemical sugar substitutes were found to have greater difficulty regulating blood sugar and people who do not normally consume artificial sweeteners experienced higher blood sugar levels after doing so for just one week. one of researchers at weizmann eran elinav told reporters during news conference that he made decision to stop using artificial sweeteners because of surprising results of study. artificial sweeteners proven to do more harm than good with scientific data that upholds dangers of artificial sweeteners within gut and other areas of body why would anyone continue consuming these dangerous substances. furthermore why are these substances still touted as safe and even beneficial for people who need to lower their sugar intake or calorie consumption. sadly there are many organizations like american cancer society that continue to push notion that aspartame is safe and does not cause cancer. just look at what they say and well let you decide how deceptive they are. in about 6.000 food products artificial sweeteners lurk in all kinds of commonly consumed products such as sugar free gum diet sodas breakfast cereals baby food and even most popular brands of yogurt. its no wonder we see steady growth of obesity diabetes and neurological diseases like alzheimers. instead of using these neurotoxin poisons to prevent or manage diabetes we must learn to enjoy natural sugars in moderation and commit to lifestyle of clean healthy living including consumption of organic vegetables fruits sprouted nuts seeds plus reasonable amount of healthy fats and proteins as much as possible. combined with active lifestyle balanced diet of real food found in nature free of artificial sweeteners and other food additives will enable you to maintain healthy blood sugar level and never be concerned about diabetes.,naturalhealth365 according to american diabetes association diabetes has become pandemic affecting 30 million people in united

found to reverse type 2 diabetes new study shows health before it 's news.,naturalhealth365 diabetes is potentially life threatening disease with complications that can include blindness stroke and heart and kidney disease. sadly this avoidable condition is reaching epidemic proportions within united states with u.s. centers for disease control and prevention cdc reporting that 30.3 million americans suffer with no end in sight for western medicine. but simple concept of calorie restriction offers solution. researchers have long maintained that being overweight which affects shocking two thirds of adult population in united states is strongly linked to diabetes. now exciting new study has corroborated this link and demonstrated that calorie restriction can reverse diabetes. what did study show about health benefits of calorie restriction. study conducted by newcastle and glasgow universities and published in september in british medical journal lancet involved 298 adults who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within past six years. half patients were put on very low calorie regimen in which they consumed between 825 and 853 calories daily in formula diet for three to five months. foods were re introduced over two to eight weeks and structured support including behavioral therapy and encouragement to exercise was given for long term weight management. other half of study group simply received standard medical care for diabetes. overwhelming majority of patients who lost 15 kg or more reversed their diabetes after year almost half 46 percent of participants in low calorie diet group achieved remission of their diabetes meaning that symptoms complications and risks of disease simply vanished along with need for medication. more weight that participants lost more striking results. for example 57 percent of those who lost 10 to 15 kg 11 to 33 pounds experienced remission. but patients who lost 33 or more pounds were biggest winners. in this group rate of remission was spectacular 90 percent. as for control group which received standard diabetes care mere 4 percent achieved remission from diabetes very poor success rate. lead researcher professor roy taylor called findings very exciting adding that they could revolutionize way diabetes is approached and treated. although calorie reduction was drastic professor taylor said that study participants apparently reported liking diet and had few complaints of hunger or fatigue. many in fact reported increased sense of well being. however patients were described as extremely motivated important factor in success of study. liver function begins to normalize after only one week of calorie restriction latest research built on 2011 study in which medical investigators confirmed that sharply limiting food intake through low calorie diet could reverse abnormal factors that cause diabetes. in phase 1 of study calories were drastically cut but participants were nt asked to exercise. in phase 2 calorie restriction became less dramatic and patients began to increase their daily activity level. surprisingly it only took week of calorie restriction for liver insulin sensitivity to begin to normalize and fasting blood sugar became normal in seven days as well. and over next eight weeks secretion of insulin continued to normalize. more good news normal metabolism persisted after study as long as weight was not gained back. conventional medical treatment for type 2 diabetes focuses on reducing blood sugar levels through use of medications but does nothing to address root causes such as obesity. excess body weight and obesity play significant role in creation of diabetes because excess calories can lead to unhealthy amounts of fat in liver making it more resistant to insulin and causing it to produce more blood sugar or glucose. excess fat in liver also causes exporting of fat to pancreas where it causes insulin production to fail. now for great news losing as little as one gram of fat from pancreas through calorie restriction can re boot normal insulin production and reverse diabetes. and researchers believe that body is capable of re setting itself in this way for up to ten years after onset of type 2 diabetes. remember some of participants had been diabetic for up to six years before study began. other studies have shown numerous benefits to calorie restriction including slowing aging process and reducing risk of cancer and heart disease. to be able to conquer complex devastating disease of diabetes simply by eating less and exercising can it really be this simple. new study results would seem to indicate that it is and that drug free non toxic and inexpensive option of calorie restriction can lead to extraordinary results. naturally you should nt try to treat diabetes with severe calorie restriction without medical supervision. talk to trusted integrative healthcare provider and be sure to take action as quickly as possible.,naturalhealth365 diabetes

one change.,diabetes is one of most rampant diseases of our time. according to american diabetes association in 2012 29.1 million americans or 9.3 of population had diabetes. 1 in fact diabetes is growing at fairly fast rate. study completed by cdc research triangle institute concluded that if recent trends in diabetes prevalence rates continue linearly over next 50 years future changes in size and demographic characteristics of u.s. population will lead to dramatic increases in number of americans with diagnosed diabetes.[2 according to current mainstream approach major goal in treating diabetes is to minimize any elevation of blood sugar glucose without causing abnormally low levels of blood sugar. type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin exercise and diabetic diet. type 2 diabetes is treated first with weight reduction diabetic diet and exercise. 3 currently belief is diabetes is chronic disease that has no cure. american diabetes association. but what if we could not only prevent diabetes before it happened but also reverse it once it shows up. in film simply raw reversing diabetes in 30 days six test subjects were used all of whom had varying lifestyles and conditions but were all diabetic- five type 2 and one type 1. each subject was taking insulin. before we get into results of this film lets take note of what is established about type 1 and type 2 diabetes. this information is from national diabetes education program type 1 diabetes body does not make insulin. insulin helps body use glucose from food for energy. people with type 1 need to take insulin every day. type 2 diabetes body does not make or use insulin well. people with type 2 often need to take pills or insulin. type 2 is most common form of diabetes. participants of program were as follows austin age 25 was not only type 1 diabetic but he also had drinking problem. kirt age 25 had blood sugar reading of 1200. normal is below 100. his doctor told him you should be dead. bill age 58 was seeing cardiologist and had neuropathy. he could not feel his feet. henry age 58 took insulin plus 9 pills daily. blood sugar was at 464. pam 62 was quite obese. her father brother and sister are also diabetic. approach gabriel cousens takes to cure people of diabetes is all about changing their diet. he states that research shows that in terms of health meat eaters have 4 times more breast cancer 3.6 times more prostate cancer 4 times more diabetes and much more in general chronic disease. if you re just having milk that s 3 times more leukemia.[4 given his position on diet he believes in taking mainly raw approach to eating and consuming plant based diet. his team prepares raw well balanced and whole meals for test subjects throughout 30 day period. food becomes their medicine. with medical supervision all of subjects took their medication as needed and ate food that is provided to them by gabriel and his team at tree of life rejuvenation center. by day 3 of program kirt bill and henry were able to stop taking insulin and medication. their blood sugar levels had already dropped to normal range after just 3 days of changing their diet. pam was able to cut her insulin intake by 1/3. austin type 1 diabetic was able to cut his insulin intake down to half. and michelle saw her blood sugar at around 362. this discouraged her to point where she did nt want to stay in program any longer although she did. by day 12 of program henrys blood sugar had dropped 256 points compared to day 1. he was not using medication to lower his blood sugar levels. although he was seeing great results henry felt he was too old for program and requested to go home. his family arrived on day 17 and he went home. by that time he was no longer taking 17 medications he had lost 30 pounds and his blood pressure had decreased. in henrys case his addiction to food he used to eat was too difficult to overcome. by very last day day 30 incredible results were seen that intensely challenges current belief that diabetes has no cure. kirt no longer needed medications. his blood sugar had dropped 214 points to as low as 73 normal without medication. it was later found out he was type 1 diabetic since beginning. status within normal range. bill stopped taking 19 medications and lost 32 pounds. his blood sugar dropped 214 points to 74 normal without medication or insulin. status within normal range. michelle stopped taking all of her medications and lost 23 pounds. her blood sugar dropped from 291 to 109 without use of medication. status within normal range. pam lost 26 pounds while her blood sugar dropped 167 points down to 112 without medication. status within normal range. austin who is type 1 diabetic lost 20 pounds and reduced his insulin from 70 units down to 5. status drastic improvement in diabetic condition. as you can see all participants had drastic turn arounds in their health and all had their diabetes either completely reversed or severely under control. type 1 diabetic kirt had his diabetes completely cured -something that is considered impossible. all type 2 diabetics no longer needed insulin. what does this tell us. like many things in modern medicine we do nt have all of answers and in lot of cases we have difficult time admitting that what is currently mainstream is nt always best course of action. people everywhere are taking alternate routes to achieve results equal to and sometimes better than what is made available to them through mainstream voices like doctors and government appointed professionals. i feel its important that people know their options and have fair chance of hearing them out. i know many people with diabetes who are nt aware of power of food in transforming their condition yet are taking insulin and following mainstream ideas as if its only truth. it is nt to say that mainstream is bad its simply that we are missing out on other options in big way. after all american diabetes association makes claims about there being no cures yet above results would suggest there is more to that story. have you ever tried raw food to cure your diabetes. we are curious to hear some real live results from others.,your

1163237,1,https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-11-13-magnesium-prevention-and-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes.html,2018-11-13T22:37:34.000Z,naturalnews.com,13,importance of magnesium in prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.,natural news estimates suggest that over 30 million americans have some form of diabetes and it is one of leading causes of death in united states. type 2 diabetes is on rise nationwide and its prevalence is increasing in both adults and children to say that type 2 diabetes is major health concern is putting it mildly. experts say that one third of adult americans could be affected by type 2 diabetes by year 2050 if something does nt change. conventional medicine has long relied on pharmaceutical approach to treating people with type 2 diabetes but research has consistently shown that proper diet and exercise are two of biggest controllable risk factors in onset of this disease. now scientists say that one particular nutrient could help prevent and treat type 2 diabetes magnesium. magnesium is mineral that is essential for over 300 different enzyme systems responsible for regulating array of biochemical reactions including protein synthesis muscle and nerve function and most pertinently blood sugar control. new research published in journal of american medical association has shown that achieving ideal magnesium intake can help prevent type 2 diabetes as well as improve blood glucose levels in people who ve already been diagnosed with condition. as natural health 365 explains magnesium helps regulate blood sugar levels through its effect on insulin receptor response. for these receptors to respond properly to insulin adequate levels of nutrient are required. standard american diet is known for being deficient in just about every nutrient. just 12 percent of average americans diet comes from plants and half of that is attributed to french fries. that means just six percent of calories most adults in u.s. eat are coming from fruits vegetables nuts and seeds. staggering 63 percent of calorie content comes from refined and processed foods and 25 percent comes from animal products. it is no surprise that we are so nutrient deficient. as environmental working group reports estimates from 2014 suggest that around 61 percent of americans are not getting enough magnesium. that is more than half adult population. if one third of adults are expected to get type 2 diabetes by 2050 it is reasonable to suspect that many of them will be magnesium deficient. according to natural health 365 study published in journal diabetes metabolism found that magnesium supplementation was effective at reducing blood sugar levels in adults diagnosed with prediabetes and magnesium deficiency. from what research says getting enough magnesium every day is key to preventing type 2 diabetes and it is helpful even for those who ve already been diagnosed. as everyday health reports site notes further that national institutes of health suggest that women who are between 19- and 30- years old get at least 310 milligrams mg of magnesium daily. men in same age range need at least 400 mg. women aged 31 and older should consume at 320 mg every day and men should take in 420 mg. experts say that people with diabetes are also at increased risk of magnesium deficiency if they have uncontrolled high blood sugar levels because their bodies may be excreting more of mineral through excess urination classic diabetes symptom. fortunately there are many foods that are rich in magnesium to choose from. dark leafy greens nuts seeds legumes and whole grains are all excellent sources of magnesium. some examples of these foods include spinach almonds cashews peanuts and black beans but there are many more. learn more about what you can do to stay healthy at prevention.news.,

levels in united states as well as other wealthy nations. autoimmune diseases though tending to receive less attention than headline grabbing afflictions such as cancer and heart disease have experienced some of most rapid increases. comprising more than 80 different diseases autoimmune conditions arise when immune system attacks bodys own organs tissues and cells. type 1 diabetesalso called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus iddm or juvenile diabetes is one of most common and rapidly increasing autoimmune diseases in children. u.s. has more children with type 1 diabetes than any other country in world with prevalence in children and adolescents that grew by 21 from 2001 to 2009. u.s. also has highest number of new cases annually well ahead of india with population four times bigger. from 2001 to 2015 new cases of type 1 diabetes in u.s. increased by roughly 2 to 4 annually in those age 19 or younger depending on region especially among 10 14 year olds. meanwhile rate of new cases in adults fell. study of type 1 diabetes in colorado spanning mid-1990s to 2010 reported even more alarming rate of increase for new cases5.7 annuallyand particularly high rates in 5 9 year age group. europe has experienced similar rates of increase but with most rapid increase reported in 0 5 age group. because of its often early age of onset and its potentially serious consequences type 1 diabetes is not something to take lightly. new study in lancet reports that about half of those with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis before age 14 and life expectancy for individuals diagnosed at younger ages is about 10 years shorter than for those diagnosed at later ages. in addition individuals with earlier onset diabetes before age of 10 have 30-times greater risk of serious cardiovascular outcomesthan those in general population whereas risk is only six times greater if type 1 diabetes is diagnosed when person is in their late 20s. diabetes often co occurs with other autoimmune conditions including celiac disease crohns disease thyroid and adrenal disorders rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus sle and neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis. childhood diagnosis of type 1 diabetes has also been shown to result in lower earnings and more unemployment in young adulthood compared to adults who are diabetes free. puzzling over dramatic rise of type 1 diabetes in young children over past several decades scientists are reaching consensus that environmental factors play significant role. as early as 1997 report on marked rise of type 1 diabetes cases in under five year olds in england suggested that environmental influences encountered before birth or in early postnatal life are likely to be responsible. current researchers continue to make same case stating substantial increase in incidence of type 1 diabetes among children over recent decades can not be consequence only of enhanced genetic disease susceptibility in population but largely must be caused by changes in lifestyle and environment. two of most widely discussed environmental candidates are dietary factors and viral infections. in light of hypothesis that viruses can be precipitating factors it has appeared logical to at least some researchers to consider whether live virus vaccines also could be contributors particularly given temporal association between expansion of childhood vaccine schedule and escalating type 1 diabetes rates. question attracted heated debate in late 1990s when virologists in finland stated that only few studies are available on subject and therefore possibility of link between vaccination and diabetes mellitus can not be excluded but nevertheless concluded that there is no clear evidence that any currently used vaccine caninduce diabetes in humans. in response immunology researcher named jb classen wrote to emphatically disagree citing epidemiology and animal toxicology studies showing link between vaccination and increased risk of type 1 diabetes for four vaccines hepatitis b if started at two months of age haemophilus influenzaetype b hib bcg against tuberculosis and measles mumps rubella mmr. regarding latter classen described spike in incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitusin finland in 1983 following introduction of mmr in both 0 to 4 and 5 to 9 age groups who received vaccine starting in late 1982 but not in 10 to 14 age group who did not receive vaccine. in his subsequent work he continued to identify statistically significant clusters of type 1 diabetes occurring two to four years after receipt of vaccines. perhaps most importantly classen encouraged researchers to take careful look at overall risk benefit calculus research into immunization has been based on theory that benefits of immunization far outweigh risks from delayed adverse events and so long term safety studies do not need to be performed. when looking at diabetesonly one potential chronic adverse eventwe found that rise in prevalence of diabetes may more than offset expected decline in long term complications of h influenzae meningitis. thus diabetes induced by vaccine should not be considered rare potential adverse event. in 2001 article in medical hypotheses classen also outlined mechanisms by which vaccines may affect onset of type 1 diabetes or other immune induced disorders emphasis added. numerous mechanisms are plausible including molecular mimicry phenomenon triggered by foreign antigens in vaccines which induce antibodies that cross react to self antigens overstimulation of immune system prompting release of proteins known to cause type 1 diabetes skewing of balance between cell mediated th1 immunity bodys first line of defense and humoral mediated th2 immunity responsible for stimulation of antibodies stimulation of macrophages innate immune cells that are key players in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes activation of smoldering subclinical autoimmunity through action of powerful aluminum and other adjuvants and replication and release of viruses such as rubella known to cause type 1 diabetes. need for long term studies currently attention is being brought to bear on methodological flaws that characterize vaccine clinical trials postlicensure monitoring and meta analyses as well as subtle and outright suppression of science that dares to question any aspect of vaccine safety. illustrating inappropriate design of some studies 2016 community randomized controlled trial of human papillomavirus hpv vaccine in adolescent boys and girls chose to assess safety and new onset autoimmune disease noad by comparing hpv group with group receiving hepatitis b virus hbv vaccine rather than using control group receiving inert placebo. roughly identical proportions of boys in both groups experienced unsolicited adverse events within 30 days and medically significant conditions by month 12 allowing investigators to blandly imply safety and conclude that no increased noad incidences were observed in hpv recipients compared to hbv recipients. this despite fact that type 1 diabetes was most common noad and was one of three types of serious adverse eventsall autoimmuneconsidered possibly related to vaccination by investigators. classen chimed in on topic of flawed study design years ago calling for longer term studies capable of detecting slower to emerge autoimmune diseases. even so one recent study that looked at 120 patients who had experienced adverse events with autoimmune or inflammatory component after receiving adjuvant containing vaccines found that 76 of events occurred in first 3 days post vaccination including three patients diagnosed with guillain barre syndrome within three days. another recent case report discussed diagnosis of type 1 diabetes ascertained within few weeks of 14-year old receiving diphtheria tetanus acellular pertussis dtap booster diagnosis of sle followed more slowly several years later. unfortunately little has changed since classen made following remarks that are still well worth heeding vaccine studies have labelled vaccine safe if it causes few adverse events in usually small study group followed for no more than 30 days post immunization. data linking vaccines to rise in wide variety of immunological diseases such as type i insulin dependent diabetes mellitushas outlined pressing need for rigorous long term vaccine safety studies. it is becoming increasingly clear that effect of vaccines on immune system is much more complicated than originally believed underlining inadequacy of current safety studies because vaccines differ from infections they prevent and have different effects on immune system. viewpoints expressed here do not necessarily represent those of infowars.

their risk of developing diabetes according to latest study which suggests that cannabis compounds may help in controlling blood sugar. although marijuana has well deserved reputation for increasing appetite via what stoners call munchies new research which was published in american journal of medicine is not first to find that drug has two faced relationship to weight. three prior studies have shown that marijuana users are less likely to be obese have lower risk for diabetes and have lower body mass index measurements. and these trends occurred despite fact that they seemed to take in more calories. why. most important finding is that current users of marijuana appeared to have better carbohydrate metabolism than nonusers says murray mittleman associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school and lead author of study. their fasting insulin levels were lower and they appeared to be less resistant to insulin produced by their body to maintain normal blood sugar level. research included over 4.600 men and women participating in national health and nutrition examination survey between 2005 and 2010. among them 48 had smoked marijuana at least once in their lives and 12 were current cannabis smokers. authors controlled for other factors like age sex income alcohol use cigarette smoking and physical activity that could also affect diabetes risk. even after these adjustments current marijuana users showed fasting insulin levels that were 16 lower than those of former or never users along with 17 reduction in another measure of insulin resistance as well. higher levels on both tests are associated with type 2 diabetes which is linked with obesity. marijuana users also had higher levels of high density lipoprotein so called good cholesterol which can protect against heart disease. and regular smokers also boasted smaller waistlines on average they were 1.5 in. 3.8 cm slimmer than former users and those who had never smoked cannabis. researchers do nt yet know how to explain these correlations and since study was not controlled trial its not clear whether marijuana or some other factor in marijuana users lifestyles actually accounted for beneficial effects. studies showed however that cannabinoid brain receptors affected by marijuana are deeply involved in appetite and metabolism. but exact details of how compound alters relationship between appetite caloric intake and insulin response is nt obvious yet. one clue however may lie in effects of diet drug that was developed to have opposite effect that marijuana has on brain. that drug rimonabant produced significant weight loss and drop in fasting insulin levels by affecting certain cannabinoid receptors in exact opposite way that thc marijuanas main psychoactive ingredient does. this action is complex rimonabant does nt simply block receptor and keep natural cannabinoids from activating it. instead while natural cannabinoids elevate normal level of activity already going on in system rimonabant lowers it so result is precisely reverse of activating receptor naturally. however because of psychiatric side effects like increasing suicide risk rimonabant was pulled from european market and never approved in u.s. how could both marijuana and compound that has opposite effect of pot act on same brain receptors and lead to weight loss. natural marijuana includes many different potentially active compounds and one of them rather than thc could be responsible for this effect. one potential candidate is substance called cannabidiol which also affects cannabinoid receptors but in different way from way thc or rimonabant does. another possibility involves tolerance repeated use of drug can make receptors less sensitive over time. most likely explanation is that prolonged cannabis use causes receptors to lose sensitivity and become inactive says daniele piomelli professor of pharmacology at university of california irvine who was not associated with new research. this has been shown to happen in people who smoke marijuana. this weakening of these receptors translates into lower risk for obesity and diabetes because inactive receptor would be unable to respond to our own cannabis like molecules which we know are important in keeping us chubby. while marijuana may initially promote appetite and overeating in long run it has opposite effect because it desensitizes cannabinoid receptors and may even protect against obesity. so do nt skip gym and break out bong just yet there s still not enough data to tell whether marijuana like alcohol could have health benefits in moderation. mittleman says study relied on self reported use of marijuana which can be unreliable. however he points out that since people are more likely to hide drug use than they are to falsely claim it findings could even underestimate marijuanas effects.,your alternative news network. broadcasting truth since 2011 alternative health alternative news conspiracy gmo

""the development of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is thought to be dependent on interaction of environmental agents with pancreatic beta cells. university of calgarylead exposure has been associated with increased risk of hypertension and is well established risk factor for kidney disease. whether lead affects blood pressure indirectly through alterations in kidney function or via more direct effects on vasculature or neurologic blood pressure control is unknown though. researchers at harvard medical school state our findings support hypothesis that long term low level lead accumulation estimated by tibia bone lead is associated with increased risk of declining renal function particularly among diabetics or hypertensives populations already at risk for impaired renal function. ""cadmium is widespread environmental pollutant that accumulates in pancreas and exerts diabetogenic effects in animals. in large cross sectional study urinary cadmium levels are significantly and dose dependently associated with both impaired fasting glucose and diabetes transsulfuration pathways in body are fundamental for life. when mercury blocks thiol groups cellular proteins lose their reactive properties lose their ability to carry out their routine function. insulin has three sulfur containing cross linkages and insulin receptor has tyrosine kinase containing sulfur bond which are preferred targets for binding by both mercury and lead. should mercury attach to one of these three sulfur bonds it will interfere with normal biological function of insulin molecule. mercury many times more toxic than lead is so dangerous exactly because it is collapsing damaging critical sulfur containing cross linkages which change geometry of both insulin receptor sites and insulin itself. ""commercials tell children that junk food is good food -- latest message from industry that spends 10 billion year marketing to children. new york timesfood is not considered junk just because of high fat or sugar content there is long list of poisonous chemicals used by food industry that are striking people down. and there are many serious nutritional deficiencies in today 's food that diminish body 's capacity to deal safely with these chemicals and heavy metals -- with magnesium and selenium deficiencies at top of list.for instance according to dr. ellen silbergeld researcher from johns hopkins school of public health poultry industry 's practice of using arsenic compounds in its feed is something that has not been studied it 's issue everybody is trying to pretend does n't exist. arsenic exposure is risk factor for diabetes mellitus. inorganic arsenic is considered one of prominent environmental causes of cancer mortality in world. chicken consumption may contribute significant amounts of arsenic to total arsenic exposure of u.s. population according to journal""arsenic acts as growth stimulant in chickens -- develops meat faster -- and since then poultry industry has gone wild using this ingredient says donald herman mississippi agricultural consultant and former environmental protection agency researcher who has studied this use of arsenic for decade. at mean levels of chicken consumption 60 g person day people may ingest 1.38 5.24 micrograms day of inorganic arsenic from chicken alone. at 99th percentile of chicken consumption 350 g chicken day people may ingest 21.13 30.59 micrograms inorganic arsenic day and 32.50 47.07 micrograms total arsenic day from chicken. this can lead to prostate cancers. it can also cause neurological cardiovascular gastrointestinal and immune system abnormalities. feeding of arsenic to chickens in united states releases hundreds of tons of arsenic into environment every year in form of poultry manure which is spread on fields as fertilizer.researchers from department of internal medicine national taiwan university hospital found association between arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus is relatively new finding. up to now there are six epidemiologic reports linking diabetes mellitus with arsenic exposure from environmental and occupational sources. two reports in taiwan carried out in blackfoot disease -- hyperendemic villages one cross sectional and one prospective follow up of same cohort -- indicate that arsenic exposure from drinking artesian well water is associated with prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus in dose responsive pattern.the observation of relation between arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus is further supported by studies carried out in sweden and bangladesh. in sweden case control analyses of death records of copper smelters and glass workers revealed trend of increasing diabetes mellitus with increasing arsenic exposure from inhalation. in bangladesh prevalence of diabetes mellitus among arsenic exposed subjects with keratosis was about five times higher than unexposed subjects. ""another example is alloxan. studies show that alloxan chemical that makes white flour look clean and beautiful destroys beta cells of pancreas. scientists have known of alloxan diabetes connection for years yet there seems to be conspiracy that defends integrity of fda which allows dangerous chemicals that can cause diabetes to be used in drugs and food. growing body of research shows that pesticides and other contaminants are more prevalent in foods we eat in our bodies and in environment than we thought all confirming chemical nightmare in progress.according to research conducted by dr. h.j. roberts diabetes specialist member of ada and authority on artificial sweeteners aspartame:1 leads to precipitation of clinical diabetes.2 causes poorer diabetic control in diabetics on insulin or oral drugs.3 leads to aggravation of diabetic complications such as retinopathy cataracts neuropathy and gastroparesis.4 causes convulsions.dr. roberts said loss of diabetic control intensification of hypoglycemia occurrence of presumed insulin reactions including convulsions that proved to be aspartame reactions and precipitation aggravation or simulation of diabetic complications especially impaired vision and neuropathy while using these products. fda 's own toxicologist dr. adrian gross told congress that without shadow of doubt aspartame can cause brain tumors and brain cancer and violated delaney amendment which forbids putting anything in food that is known to cause cancer. it is monstrous crime to poison food and water supplies yet this is exactly what fda has been approving and undoubtedly they are in large part responsible for flaming diabetic winds. as use of msg and aspartame grows incidence of obesity appears to be growing.msg causes very large insulin response after it is ingested since there are glutamate receptors in pancreas. msg opens calcium channels thus constricting blood vessels this may put diabetics with high blood pressure at risk by negating calcium channel blocker medication. in 1968 john w. olney m.d. respected researcher at washington university medical school st. louis missouri and member of national academy of science found that mice in his laboratory that were being used to replicate 1957 study by lucas and newhouse in which administration of msg had resulted in retinal damage had become grotesquely obese. since 1969 many scientists have confirmed dr. olney 's findings of damage to hypothalamus from msg with resulting obesity. even rats used in obesity diabetes and exercise studies are made obese by injecting msg. msg may cause food addiction and though efforts have been made to reduce its use in processed and restaurant foods it remains hidden by semantics now called such things as hydrolyzed protein. scientists in spain have recently concluded that msg when given to mice increases appetite by as much as 40%.there is abundant literature demonstrating that msg and aspartic acid cause hypothalamic lesions which in turn can cause gross obesity. although there are number of causes for obesity there is no question that one of main causes for obesity epidemic is ever increasing use of msg and aspartame.we know that hypothalamus is very immature at birth. damage to this structure of brain by msg leads to severe endocrine problems later in life among them decreased thyroid hormone increased tendency toward diabetes and higher cortisone levels than normal. child consuming soup containing msg plus drink with nutrasweet will have blood level of excitotoxins six times blood level that destroys hypothalamus neurons in baby mice.and we are just beginning to hear that massive mistake has been made with genetically modified foods which can only fan those diabetic winds. dr. arpad pusztai for instance has already shown that genetically manipulated foods can when fed to animals in reasonable amounts cause very gradual organ and immune system damage. another study carried out by dr. irina ermakova at institute of higher nervous activity and neurophysiology at russian academy of sciences found that more than half of offspring of rats fed on modified soya died in first three weeks of life six times as many as those born to mothers with normal diets. dr. manuela malatesta and colleagues in universities of pavia and urbino in italy showed that mice fed on gm soya experienced slowdown in cellular metabolism and modifications to liver and pancreas. researchers are reviving fears that gm food damages human health and certainly would not be indicated for children or for people with diabetes.many bottled soft drinks and related beverages contain benzene well known carcinogen. epa defines safe level of benzene as zero. yet environmental working group watchdog organization found levels of benzene in soft drinks at levels between 5 and 138 parts per billion.a fair amount of benzene is taken in by our bodies by air pollution and drinking water. u.s. food and drug administration has known for almost 15 years that potassium benzoate and sodium benzoate react with ascorbic acid to form benzenes. potassium benzoate sodium benzoate and ascorbic acids are all commonly used to preserve freshness in soft drinks.the excess of diabetes reported for benzene sub registry occurred in group aged 10 to 17 years suggesting it is likely that iddm is type of diabetes most prevalent. it has been demonstrated that most iddm patients have autoantibodies to pancreas lernmark et al. 1981 as well as to other organs benzene has been shown to stimulate hypothalamic pituitary adrenocortical hpa axis of mice hsieh et al. 1991 accompanied by increased acth corticosterone release into blood.corticosteroids are associated with development of diabetes by reducing insulin sensitivity or possibly by impairing islet function frequently associated with development of impaired glucose tolerance. secretion of anti insulin hormones such as growth hormones or adrenocorticotrophic hormone acth are also believed to play important role in iddm development rodriguez 1986. steroid hormones play important role in determining severity of beta cell damage in infected mouse with androgens and glucocorticoids being particularly critical craighead 1981. ethanol can enhance immunosuppressive effects of benzene. in addition it has been demonstrated that various benzene metabolites depress production of interferon cheung et al. 1988 popp et al. 1992. iddm is associated with variety of hematologic changes such as anemia and malignancies such as lymphocytic leukemia lymphoma and multiple myeloma that might be directly related to or simply coincidental with diabetes bern 1982. from literature reported it can be seen that all of these conditions are also associated with exposure to benzene.anthropogenic emissions to air are approximately 34.000 metric tons per year usepa 1989 absorption of benzene varies with route of exposure. in humans respiratory uptake has been determined to vary from approximately 47 nomiyama and nomiyama 1974 to 80 srbova et al. 1950 although dermal absorption can range from 0.05 to 0.2 franz 1984. absorption data for oral exposure in humans is not available however in animals absorption rates following oral exposure to benzene were found to be from 90 to almost 100 parke and williams ingestion of contaminated food items has been suggested as potentially important pathway of human exposure to benzene hattemer frey et al. 1990 and many foods contain high levels of benzene. benzene is ubiquitous in environment having been measured in air water and human biological samples. major environmental sources include automobile exhaust automobile refueling hazardous waste sites underground storage tanks that leak waste water from industries that use benzene chemical spills chemical manufacturing sites and petrochemical and petroleum industries fishbein 1992 edgerton and shah 1992).recently drinking more than one soft drink daily -- whether it 's regular or diet -- may be associated with increase in risk factors for heart disease and diabetes framingham researchers reported in. in those who drink one or more soft drinks daily there was association of increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. metabolic syndrome is cluster of cardiovascular disease and diabetes risk factors including excess waist circumference high blood pressure elevated triglycerides low levels of high density lipoprotein hdl good cholesterol and high fasting glucose levels.prior studies linked soft drink consumption to multiple risk factors for heart disease. however this study showed that association not only included drinking regular calorie laden soft drinks but artificially sweetened diet sodas as well researchers said. if you are drinking one or more soft drinks day you may be increasing your risk of developing metabolic risk factors for heart disease. ""the researchers also observed that compared to participants who drank less than one soft drink daily those who drank one or more soft drinks day had 31 percent greater risk of developing new onset obesity defined as body mass index bmi of 30 kilograms meter2 or more 30 percent increased risk of developing increased waist circumference 25 percent increased risk of developing high blood triglycerides or high fasting blood glucose 32 percent higher risk of having low hdl levels. it did n't matter whether it was diet or regular soft drink"". ""results also do n't appear to be driven by dietary pattern of soft drink users i.e by other food items that are typically consumed along with soft drinks vasan study author said. so perhaps what we have blamed for so long high fructose corn syrups empty calories aspartame in soft drinks is not only thing causing increase in these diabetic risk factors. in combination with benzenes it is highly likely that we have found yet another toxic substance that adds to our inability to avoid diabetes. ""diabetes may in fact be major side effect of antibiotics and other common pharmaceuticals. dr. lisa landymore lim independent scientist for atomic health limiteddoctors are on notice that many drugs have toxic effects that can participate in destroying insulin creation and cell receptivity to it. in her 1994 book poisonous prescriptions landymore lim says that diabetes may in fact be major side effect of pharmaceutical drugs. book provides evidence from studies and hospital records. diabetes usually thought to be largely genetic disorder may actually have increased so much in last 50 years due in large part to proliferation in use and over use of medicines. in 2004 american diabetes association american psychiatric association north american association for study of obesity and american association of clinical endocrinologists made similar announcement warning people to be careful to watch for signs they are developing diabetes obesity or high cholesterol if they are taking abilify clozaril geodon risperdal seroquel or zyprexa. what medicines food and water have increasingly in common are chemical poisons they contain.researchers at university of liverpool recently released their studies that examined toxic effects on nerve cells in laboratory of using combination of four common food additives -- aspartame monosodium glutamate msg and artificial colourings brilliant blue and quinoline yellow. findings of their two year study were published at end of 2005 in journal. liverpool team reported that when mouse nerve cells were exposed to msg and brilliant blue or aspartame and quinoline yellow in laboratory conditions combined in concentrations that theoretically reflect compound that enters bloodstream after typical children 's snack and drink additives stopped growing of nerve cells and interfered with proper signaling systems. mixtures of additives had much more potent effect on nerve cells than each additive on its own.the study reported that effect on cells could be up to four times greater when brilliant blue and msg were combined and up to seven times greater when quinoline yellow and aspartame were combined than when additives were applied on their own. what we can begin to conclude is that future research is going to show how all toxic chemicals in food air water and medicines we consume are combining to destroy our health. any one poison discussed here in sufficient quantity can destroy cell physiology pancreas beta cells and diminish cell receptivity to insulin.we are depending more and more on processed foods and with each year fda approves more and more chemicals for use in foods. with each year food industry is using more and more chemicals in their products. these chemicals increase shelf life kill bacteria improve taste replace fats replace carbohydrates and cause chronic diseases that eventually kill people. junk food is really cover up image for something quite bit nastier than image that junk congers. junk foods are actually slow acting poisons because they come to us loaded with highly toxic chemicals. we can only imagine worst when we think about fda approval processes for in reality fda is poisoning public. fda is wellhead of most iatrogenic diseases and death. there is no excuse for agency charged with protecting public health to have allowed massive poisoning of public via food drugs and public water supplies.bisphenol bpa exposure may lead to obesity altered glucose metabolism insulin resistance and diabetes. not only are chemicals used in foods affecting rates of diabetes but chemicals used in everyday plastics are contributing to rise in obesity and insulin resistance.debate over bpa is one of most contentious environmental health issues faced by government and industry. traces are found in bodies of nearly all americans tested and low levels -- similar to amounts that can leach from infant and water bottles mimic estrogen.extensive scientific literature reports adverse health effects from bisphenol at very low doses. studies show that bisphenol can alter expression of several hundred genes with effects varying among special tissues and depending upon timing of exposure. more than 150 laboratory animal studies suggest that bisphenol exposure at very low doses is linked to staggering number of health problems including prostate and breast cancer obesity hyperactivity diabetes altered immune system lowered sperm count and early puberty.a study by dr. beverly rubin and her colleagues at tufts university medical school showed that bisphenol makes rodents grow larger after they are exposed in womb confirming similar findings from previous studies 17. when rats were fed 100 g kg day of bisphenol during pregnancy through lactation their offspring were notably heavier after birth and into adulthood. significantly in female offspring lower of two bisphenol doses used in study produced larger and more persistent effect on body weight relative to higher dose. in addition fact that effect persisted long after exposure for female offspring suggests that bisphenol may increase number of fat cells in rats and predispose them to heavier weight throughout life.in 2002 team of researchers at ehime college of health science in japan discovered that bisphenol can increase conversion of embryonic cells into fat cells 18. in body this effect could result in larger numbers of fat cells developing. in addition to converting to fat cells treated cells increased their fat content by 150 percent over 11 days. combined with insulin bisphenol increased fat content of cells by 1300 percent. in other words this experiment documented that bisphenol could trigger and promote two main processes in developing obesity. in 2004 another study confirmed these findings showing that bisphenol alone and with insulin increased uptake of sugar into fat cells 19).a recent study by dr. paloma alonso magdalena and her colleagues showed that low level chronic exposure of adult mice to 10 g kg day of bisphenol caused insulin resistance precursor to type ii diabetes in people as well as hypertension and cardiovascular disease 20. dr. alonso magdalena 's study showed that even single dose of bisphenol at levels currently found in humans can result in altered levels of blood glucose and insulin and twice daily exposure for just four days results in insulin resistance.several studies show increased rate of postnatal growth in both males and females as result of maternal doses between 2.4 and 500 g kg day 21. accelerated postnatal growth is associated not just with obesity but with insulin resistant diabetes hypertension and heart disease as well.is it any wonder that we are seeing rising rate of diabetes in our children and adolescents. use of bisphenol and products containing them have increased through years as our use of glass and safer non plastic containers has decreased. its hard to even find non plastic onctainers for everyday use. and what is especially disturbing is news coming to light that bisphenol is being used in baby bottles for feeding of our infants at very early age.the number of children in u.s. that are overweight have doubled in last 30 years national institutes of health. currently about 20 of children or one child in five is overweight. increase is true for children and adolescents of all age groups and races and for boys and girls.bisphenol is polycarbonate plastic. bisphenol based polycarbonate is used as plastic coating for children 's teeth to prevent cavities as coating in metal cans to prevent metal from contact with food contents as plastic in food containers refrigerator shelving baby bottles water bottles sport drink bottles returnable containers for juice milk and water micro wave ovenware and eating utensils. in small prospective study researchers in japan report that bisphenol levels are higher in women with history of repeated spontaneous miscarriages. this research was based on proof that bpa causes meiotic aneuploidy in mice. meiotic aneuploidy is commonest cause of miscarriage in people.the effects of this chemical on our chromosomes will reach into generations yet to come affecting not only ourselves but our children and our grandchildren. researchers have found that effects of continual low dose exposures may not show up for years. growing children are particularly at risk to toxic chemicals in their environment because they are physiologically more susceptible to them.the lancet analysed prevalence of type 2 diabetes in ontario canada between 1995 and 2005. it found increase of 69 per cent over 10 years compared with world health organisation 's prediction of 39 per cent increase between 2000 and 2030. dr. lorraine lipscombe of institute for clinical evaluation science toronto said that it also saw higher rise in rate of cases in younger people under 50 than in older people. 27 per cent increase has taken place after only five years she said. rising rates of obesity could be cause of this striking growth and effective public health interventions to manage and prevent obesity are sorely needed. ""the cdc says that diabetes is disabling deadly and on rise. incidence of diabetes is skyrocketing not only in adults but in juvenile population as well. healthcare experts have called alarming rise in diabetes and its related complications epidemic that threatens to spiral out of control.in 1997 15.7 millions adults in united states were reported to have diabetes. by year 2002 this number had already swelled to 18.0 million or 8.7 of all adults. diabetes and its complications now claim hundreds of thousands of lives in u.s. each year incurring total expenses of over 130 billion in direct and indirect costs to healthcare system. worldwide number of people with adult onset diabetes is predicted to explode in next 10 years doubling to estimated 221 million people. by contrast only 43.171 people in united states were diagnosed with aids and only 18.017 died.scientists have discovered variant gene that leads to sizable extra risk of type 2 diabetes -- 38 percent of americans who have inherited single copy of gene have 45 percent greater risk of type 2 estimated 7 percent who carry two copies are 141 percent more likely to develop disease. what scientists are saying is that if all variant genes in population were erased so would be 21 percent of diabetes cases. another way of expressing variations in genetic makeup is constitution. some people are gifted with stronger constitutions genes than others and are more able to stand up to massive chemical assaults on their bodies. genetic causes do not in anyway explain explosive increases in diabetes but increasing concentrations of environmental poisons penetrating our bodies via our air water food and medicines can evoke breakdowns in genetic function.women who reported mixing and applying agricultural pesticides during early pregnancy have two times higher risk of developing gestational diabetes during pregnancy. strong association between first trimester pesticide exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus suggests that pesticide exposures may affect glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. specifically four herbicides 2.4.5-t 2.4.5-tp atrazine or butylate and three insecticides diazinon phorate or carbofuran were associated with reporting gestational diabetes. women who reported agricultural pesticide exposure mixing or applying pesticides to crops or repairing pesticide application equipment during pregnancy were more than twice as likely to report gdm as compared to women reporting no pesticide use in pregnancy.exposure to dioxins by any route is known to cause various systemic effects in exposed animals. general population is exposed to small amounts of dioxins as exemplified by fact that dioxins have been found in virtually all samples of adipose tissue and blood serum lipids from individuals with no known previous exposure. it is primarily dioxins with chlorine atoms in 2 3 7 and 8 positions that are retained in animals and humans and which selectively concentrate in body fat and lipids. recent study on health status of vietnam veterans who participated in operation ranch hand did not find any signs of liver disease but did report increased levels of triglycerides and cholesterol in blood second report does not support these increases. in addition increase in body fat diabetes and blood pressure were also noted. these effects were strongly associated with tcdd levels in serum.ranch hand veterans also had changes in blood increased white blood cells platelet iga and sedimentation rates which suggest chronic inflammatory response. it has take two decades of litigation for u.s. government to finally recognize devastating effects of dioxin exposure that have disabled our veterans with cancers and diabetes. average time it takes to remove one half of tcdd from body is around 7 years. half lives of other dioxins in body are not known. about 98 of daily intake of dioxins for general population comes from ingesting food and milk. inhalation exposure to dioxins for general population constitutes minor portion of daily intake. average intake of tcdd for adults has been calculated to be about 25 picograms pg per day or 0.35 pg per kilogram kg of body weight per day. if all dioxins and furans are included and tefs are used total average daily intake of tcdd equivalents for adults is about 90 pg day or 1.3 pg kg body wt day.there are numerous other sources that contribute to dioxins in environment. dioxins are known to form concurrently with furans during combustion processes such as incineration of municipal solid waste and industrial waste and are associated with ash generated in incineration process. emissions from these sources vary greatly and depend on management practices and applied technologies. combustion of many chlorine containing materials such as plastic material like polyvinyl chloride paper wood treated with pentachlorophenols pesticide treated waste and pcbs can produce dioxins and furans. dioxins and furans have also been detected in emissions from coal fired power plants home heating systems exhaust from cars running on leaded gasoline and cigarette smoke.phthalates are group of man made chemicals that are structurally related to organic acid phthalic acid. most important use of phthalates is in plastics especially pvc where they act as plasticisers. phthalates are also present in wide range of industrial household and consumer products including personal care products. such as nail polish hair sprays soaps shampoos perfumes moisturizers. they are found in pipes vinyl wall and floor coverings roofing materials safety glass car parts lubricating oils detergents food packaging adhesives paints inks medical tubing blood bags pharmaceuticals footwear electrical cables stationery and until recently in toys.more than 75 of u.s. population carries detectable levels of several phthalate metabolites. studies have found associations between some phthalate metabolites and antiandrogenic effects in humans including both infant and adult males. recently study published inshowed that exposure to phthalates correlated with two metabolic abnormalities in men abdominal obesity and insulin resistance. four phthalate metabolites were significantly associated with greater waist circumference and three with increased insulin resistance pcp organic chemical pentachlorophenol was used in timber industry for years as cheap treatment for sapstain fungal infection commonly found in softwoods such as pine. it is organic chemical produced by reacting chlorine gas with phenol. process creates number of toxic impurities such as tetrachlorophenol hexachlorobenzene and several types of dioxins and dibenzofurans. main route of absorption is through skin. some of more chronic health effects including cancer and diabetes do not appear until long after exposure. sawmill workers were constantly exposed to pcp as they mixed chemicals and handled wet treated timber.according to world health organization diamond project group on epidemics major difficulty in area of iddm research -- despite strong epidemiologic evidence that environmental agents are potent causes of iddm diabetes epidemiology research international 1987 -- is that identification of such agents has been elusive. it is noteworthy that several recent epidemiologic studies have reported that incidence of iddm is increasing suggesting that long term changes in environment are altering probability of eventual diabetes.among most pernicious substances ever created is group of chemicals known as pops or persistent organic pollutants. among them ddt dioxins pcbs and chlordane. and even though twelve pops -- so called dirty dozen -- were restricted or banned by international convention in 2003 they continue to pose threat to people and wildlife because pops accumulate in food we eat. virtually every person on planet has pops in their body and chemicals have been linked to cancers birth defects and disabilities. now group of researchers in korea have found strong evidence linking pops and diabetes.dr. david carpenter professor of environmental health and toxicology at state

diabetes what are risks involved triggers of diabetic issues are still not totally recognized. neither are healthcare experts ready to make clear why some people establish diabetic issues and other individuals never. certain variables have however been clearly discovered which lead to growth of diabetic issues. heredity is important component. that diabetic issues can be inherited has been regarded for generations. nonetheless pattern of inheritance is not totally recognized. statistic suggests that those with relatives background of ailment have increased hazard of building diabetic issues than those devoid of these kinds of background. hazard component is twenty five to 33 p.c more. kids are most probable to establish diabetic issues if possibly or both parents are diabetic issues or if expectant mother grew to become diabetic or if mother was verified diabetic prior to conception. this might not always be correct. it is possible for parents who were or are diabetic and other stays totally free from ailment. it is however vital that blood sugar degree of expectant mother who is diabetic be managed in regular selection so that diabetic issues is not passed on to her boy or girl. it blood sugar degree is held less than control infant might not have nay signs of inherited diabetic issues but hazard component are unable to be dominated out. one particular cause why diabetic issues particularly kind-2 diabetic issues operates in relatives is mainly because of diabetic issues gene. but even it is prompted by genetic variables past your control there is no cause to put up with from it. diabetes mellitus are unable to be healed in entire feeling of time period but it can be successfully controlled so that you would not know change. intense genetic analysis is now underway to determine genes affiliated with both kind-1 and kind-2 diabetic issues. in examine sponsored by national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney health conditions of usa kin at hazard of kind-1 diabetic issues are staying dealt with with very low doses of possibly insulin or oral medicine to figure out if medication might avert ailment. surveys demonstrate that in india diabetic issues is more widespread amongst males than females. in this populace relatives background of diabetic issues mellitus was existing in 5.5 to 11.6 for every cent. amongst diabetics 18.three for every cent urban and 6.four p.c of rural populace experienced immediate relative with diabetic issues. therefore genetic predisposition in india is equivalent to that observed in other parts of globe. diabetes has been described by most healthcare experts as prosperity ailment largely prompted by systematic overeating. not only is taking in way too considerably sugar and refined carbohydrates hazardous but proteins and fats which are transformed into sugar might also result in diabetic issues if taken in excess. too considerably meals taxes pancreas and eventually its regular action of developing insulin gets paralyzed. it is intriguing to note that diabetic issues is virtually unfamiliar in nations around world where people are very poor and are unable to afford to overeat. incidence of diabetic issues is right joined with use of processed food items loaded in refined carbohydrates like biscuits bread cakes chocolates pudding and ice lotions. in britain in course of war when only whole wheat bread was obtainable incidence of diabetic issues dropped by fifty five p.c. dad and mom really should get good treatment to establish accurate dietary behavior in their young children. kids really should be prevented from getting to be addicts to hazardous food items like ice cream cakes jam jelly peppermint chocolates and other sweets. volume of meals specified to young children really should be these kinds of as would make it possible for progress but not weight problems. kids really should be persuaded about great importance of exercise and online games and sports activities really should be inspired. ideal physique pounds and proportionate physique is virtually specific assurance towards diabetic issues. obesity is single of principal results in of diabetic issues. scientific tests demonstrate that sixty to 85 of diabetics are inclined to be overweight. in united states of america about 80 p.c of kind 2 non insulin dependent diabetics are claimed to be overweight. during next planet war when there was decrease in typical pounds of people incidence of diabetic issues arrived down substantially. greater weight problems greater is mortality price owing to issues of diabetic issues. excess extra fat prevents insulin from doing job appropriately. more fatty tissue in physique more resistant muscle mass and tissue cells become to physique insulin. insulin makes it possible for sugar in blood to enter cells by performing on receptor internet sites on floor of cells. in weight problems where man or woman is overweight by twenty p.c of ideal pounds or has superior uric acid or some syndromes receptors are sparse and functionally idle. this is observed in individuals building diabetic issues around age of forty decades and obtaining kind-2 non insulin dependent diabetic issues. it is estimated that incidence of diabetic issues is four instances increased in folks of moderates weight problems and three instances increased in folks of serious weight problems. it has been rightly mentioned heredity is like cannon and weight problems pulls and trigger. older people normally are inclined to acquire pounds and same time lot of of them establish and mild kind of diabetic issues mainly because who are over pounds can normally strengthen their blood sugar only by shedding pounds. in some cases it is all that is essential to deliver blood sugar back into regular selection. even small pounds decline can have advantageous outcomes reducing blood sugar levels or making it possible for medicines to get job done better. nonetheless sudden acquire in pounds might cause diabetic issues to return. it is for that reason important for more mature people to keep their pounds down to regular. among those detected to be diabetic virtually single 3rd are overweight. pancreatic infections with coxsackies b virus can result in beta mobile damage growth of autoantibodies and as result kind-1 insulin dependent diabetic issues mellitus. some of these can be identified by viral antibody exam and islet mobile antibody exam. screening for antibodies can show perhaps juvenile diabetic issues in relatives on foundation of car immunity. sedentary life style resulting from deficiency of actual physical get job done and exercise plays enhancement part in growth of diabetic issues. less energetic man or woman greater hazard of building diabetic issues. contemporary conveniences have designed get job done less difficult. physical action and exercise helps control pounds makes use of up ton of glucose sugar existing in blood as strength and makes cells more sensitive to insulin. consequently workload on pancreas is reduced. training also provides to muscle mass mass. typically concerning 70 p.c to 90 p.c of blood sugar is absorbed into muscle mass. reduction in muscle mass mass possibly owing to age of actual physical inactivityreduces storage space for blood sugar and it stays in blood stream. cigarette smoking is further important hazard component. among males who smoke hazard of building diabetic issues is doubled. in gals who smoke twenty five or more cigarettes working day hazard of building diabetic issues is enhanced by forty p.c. cigarette smoking also minimizes retinal blood stream and raises hazard of building retinopathy. it also decreases insulin absorption and limitations joints mobility. cigarette smoking in combination with diabetic issues tremendously boosts probability of untimely mortality. it also depends on variety of cigarettes working day man or woman smokes and variety of decades he has been smoking. hazard of kind-2 diabetic issues raises as single grows more mature particularly higher than age of 45 decades. portion of cause is that is people improve more mature they are inclined to become less physically energetic eliminate muscle mass mass and acquire pounds. with daily life models getting to be more sedentary there has been raise of diabetic issues amongst people in there 30s and 40s. stress can be emotional or actual physical these kinds of as surgical procedures or serious infection accident or emotional shock. yet another incredibly urban trait superior tension life style not just amongst youthful unwardly cell but increasingly in all walks of daily life is comparatively new phenomenon in india. given that there is regarded link concerning tension and diabetic issues mellitus those who are less than tension and/or guide irregular life style want to get suitable safeguards and make important life style adjustments. pancreatic insufficiency prompted by tension can guide to diabetic issues. grief get worried and panic resulting from examinations loss of life of shut relative decline of joy enterprise failure and strained marital partnership all deep impact on rate of metabolism and might cause sugar to seem in urine. diabetes might be affiliated with some grave natural and organic problems like most cancers tuberculosis and cerebral ailments. diabetes might also be prompted by wide range of other variables. these include things like specific metabolic and genetic problems insufficient

can do for people with type 2 diabetes cancer alzhiemers disease.,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed your sickness. hippocrates fasting has not received as much attention as it should when it comes to world of health and medicine. that s because you ca nt really make any money off of it. pharmaceutical science studies used in medical schools to teach doctors about human health simply do nt focus enough on fasting for doctors to be knowledgable in subject. doctors also learn very little about nutrition and are trained to prescribe drugs as result. dr. jason fung is trying to change all that. toronto based nephrologist he completed medical school and internal medicine at university of toronto before finishing his nephrology fellowship at university of california los angeles at cedars sinai hospital. he joined scarborough general hospital in 2001 where he continues to practice and change peoples lives. he is one of growing number of scientists and doctors to create awareness about tremendous health benefits that can be achieved from fasting. its one of oldest dietary interventions in world and has been practiced for thousands of years. if properly practiced fasting was bad or harmful in any way as some doctors suggest it would have been known by now and studies would not be emerging showing health benefits that can be achieved from fasting regularly. for example recent study published in journal cell shows how fasting diet can trigger pancreas to regenerate itself which works to control blood sugar levels and reverse symptoms of diabetes. there is absolutely no evidence for average person that fasting can be dangerous. if you re on prescription medication or experience other medical problems then there are obviously exceptions. but its quite clear that human body was designed to go long periods of time without food and that its completely natural. dr. fung recently published book co authored with jimmy moore titled complete guide to fasting heal your body through intermittent alternate day and extended fasting its great book that puts to rest fears and myths associated with extended water fasting. he also recently published obesity code unlocking secrets of weight loss fung like 90 percent of doctors out there was conventionally oriented. he is kidney specialist and many of his patients had have type 2 diabetes as result of that. it eventually became clear to him that something was very wrong with conventional treatment of type 2 diabetes. with type 2 diabetes patients who take insulin and follow recommended dietary guidelines would still have several complications mainly kidney disease. because of this they can go blind require dialysis or even require amputations. in interview below with dr. joseph mercola dr. fung addresses multiple myths and issues that are commonly brought up about fasting. and dives into explaining how fasting does not burn muscle how it can reverse diabetes addresses starvation mode myth explains role of insulin discusses different variations of fasting and much more. be sure to visit his website where you can find information on him his practice results lectures and article that he continually publishes every month. humans live on one quarter of what they eat on other three quarters lives their doctor. egyptian pyramid inscription below is tedx talk given by mark mattson current chief of laboratory of neuroscience at national institute on aging. he is also professor of neuroscience at johns hopkins university and one of foremost researchers of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying multiple neurodegenerative disorders like parkinsons and alzheimers disease. dr. mattson also addresses this issue toward end of his video lecture summary and science to go with it mark and his team have published several papers that discuss how fasting twice week could significantly lower risk of developing both parkinsons and alzheimers disease. dietary changes have long been known to have effect on brain. children who suffer from epileptic seizures have fewer of them when placed on caloric restriction or fasts. it is believed that fasting helps kick start protective measures that help counteract overexcited signals that epileptic brains often exhibit. some children with epilepsy have also benefited from specific high fat low carbohydrate diet. normal brains when overfed can experience another kind of uncontrolled excitation impairing brains function mattson and another researcher reported in january in journal nature reviews neuroscience. source basically when you take look at caloric restriction studies many of them show prolonged lifespan as well as increased ability to fight chronic disease. according to review of fasting literature conducted in 2003 calorie restriction cr extends life span and retards age related chronic diseases in variety of species including rats mice fish flies worms and yeast. mechanism or mechanisms through which this occurs are unclear. work presented below however is now showing some of these mechanisms that were previously unclear. fasting does good things for brain and this is evident by all of beneficial neurochemical changes that happen in brain when we fast. it improves cognitive function and stress resistance increases neurotrophic factors and reduces inflammation. fasting is challenge to your brain and your brain responds to that challenge by adapting stress response pathways that help your brain cope with stress and disease risk. same changes that occur in brain during fasting mimic changes that occur with regular exercise both increase production of protein in brain neurotrophic factors which in turn promotes growth of neurons connection between neurons and strength of synapses. as he explains in video challenges to your brain whether its intermittent fasting or vigorous exercise. is cognitive challenges. when this happens neuro circuits are activated levels of neurotrophic factors increase that promotes growth of neurons and formation and strengthening of synapses. fasting can also stimulate production of new nerve cells from stem cells in hippocampus. he also mentions how fasting stimulates production of ketones energy source for neurons and that it may also increase number of mitochondria in neurons. fasting also increases number of mitochondria in nerve cells since neurons adapt to stress of fasting by producing more mitochondria. by increasing number of mitochondria in neurons ability for nerons to form and maintain connections between each other also increases thereby improving learning and memory ability. intermittent fasting enhances ability of nerve cells to repair dna. he also goes into evolutionary aspect of this theory explaining how our ancestors adapted and were built for going long periods of time without food. study published in june 5 issue of cell stem cell by researchers from university of southern california showed that cycles of prolonged fasting protect against immune system damage and moreover induce immune system regeneration. they concluded that fasting shifts stem cells from dormant state to state of self renewal triggering stem cell based regeneration of organ or system source. human clinical trials were conducted using patients who were receiving chemotherapy. for long periods of time patients did not eat which significantly lowered their white blood cell counts. in mice fasting cycles flipped regenerative switch changing signalling pathways for hematopoietic stem cells which are responsible for generation of blood and immune systems. this means that fasting kills off old and damaged immune cells and when body rebounds it uses stem cells to create brand new completely healthy cells. we could not predict that prolonged fasting would have such remarkable effect in promoting stem cell based regeneration of heatopoietic system. when you starve system tries to save energy and one of things it can do to save energy is to recycle lot of immune cells that are not needed especially those that may be damaged. what we started noticing in both our human work and animal work is that white blood cell count goes down with prolonged fasting. then when you re feed blood cells come back. scientific review of multiple scientific studies regarding fasting was published in american journal of clinical nutrition in 2007. it examined multitude of both human and animal studies and determined that fasting is effective way to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer. it also showed significant potential in treating diabetes. source before you fast make sure you do your research. personally i ve been fasting for years so it is something that comes easy for me. one recommended way of doing it which was tested by bbcs michael mosley in order to reverse his diabetes high cholesterol and other problems associated with his obesity is what is known as 5:2 diet. on 5:2 plan you cut your food down to one fourth of your normal daily calories on fasting days about 600 calories for men and about 500 for women while consuming plenty of water and tea. on other five days of week you can eat normally. another way to do it as mentioned above is to restrict your food intake between hours of 11 am and 7 pm daily while not eating during hours outside of that time. ultimately proper diet remains critical to good health and how you think about what you are putting in your body is important piece of that puzzle which i believe will eventually be established in unbiased and uninfluenced medical literature of future. below is video of dr. joseph mercola explaining benefits of intermittent fasting and here is great article by him that explains how he believes intermittent fasting can help you live healthier life.,everyone has physician inside him or her we just have to help it in its work. natural healing force within each one of us is greatest force in getting well. our food should be our medicine. our medicine should be our food. but to eat when you are sick is to feed.

natural alternative medicine used for treating diabetes psoriasis weight loss cancer and more. ,one alternative medicine frequently sought to treat diabetes and other adverse health conditions is aloe vera plant. for centuries this amazing plant has been used for variety of medicinal purposes including treating diabetes cancer skin care weight loss psoriasis sunburns and more. recently there was pooled analysis of nine studies that examined effect of oral aloe vera in people with diabetes and pre diabetes. heres more on recent findings plus remedies and other medicinal uses this wonderful plant has to offer. name aloe vera is derived from arabic word alloeh meaning shining bitter substance. two thousand years ago greek scientists regarded aloe vera as universal panacea. egyptians called aloe plant of immortality. botanical name of aloe vera is aloe barbadensis miller. it belongs to asphodelaceae liliaceae family. it is shrubby perennial pea- green color plant. aloe vera plant grows mainly in dry regions of asia europe america and africa. in india its found in maharashtra gujarat tamil nadu rajasthan and andhra pradesh. today aloe vera plant has been used for various purposes in dermatology as well as other natural health remedies. aloe vera has been used as folk medicine for centuries. people of india mexico japan china egypt and greece have used aloe vera for variety of medicinal purposes for thousands of years. historically aloe was used topically to heal wounds and for various skin conditions. today aloe vera is used as alternative remedy for variety of conditions including diabetes asthma epilepsy and osteoarthritis. aloe vera has been found to be useful in treatment for seborrheic dermatitis psoriasis vulgaris and genital herpes as well. additional topical uses help to relieve sunburns burns and osteoarthritis. and u.s. food and drug administration fda approved aloe vera as natural food flavoring. vitamins aloe vera plant contains vitamins beta carotene c and e which are antioxidants. it also contains vitamin b12 folic acid and choline. antioxidant neutralizes free radicals. enzymes aloe vera contains eight enzymes aliiase alkaline phosphatase amylase bradykinase carboxypeptidase catalase cellulase lipase and peroxidase. bradykinase helps to reduce excessive inflammation when applied to skin topically while others help in breakdown of sugars and fats. minerals plant provides calcium chromium copper selenium magnesium manganese potassium sodium and zinc. they are essential for proper functioning of various enzyme systems in different metabolic pathways and few are antioxidants. sugars aloe vera provides monosaccharides glucose and fructose and polysaccharides glucomannans polymannose. these are derived from mucilage layer of plant and are known as mucopolysaccharides. recently glycoprotein with antiallergic properties called alprogen and novel anti inflammatory compound c glucosyl chromone has been isolated from aloe vera gel. anthraquinones it provides 12 anthraquinones which are phenolic compounds traditionally known as laxatives. aloin and emodin act as analgesics antibacterials and antivirals. fatty acids aloe vera plant provides four plant steroids cholesterol campesterol -sisosterol and lupeol. all these have anti inflammatory action. lupeol has antiseptic and analgesic properties. hormones plant contains auxins and gibberellins. this compounds help in healing wounds. they also have anti inflammatory action. other uses aloe vera provides 20 of 22 human required amino acids and 7 of 8 essential amino acids. it also contains salicylic acid that possesses anti inflammatory and antibacterial properties. lignin inert substance when included in topical preparations boosts penetrative effect of other ingredients into skin. saponins are soapy substances that form about 3 percent of gel and have cleansing and antiseptic properties. diabetes is global epidemic and leading cause of disease and death. recently there was pooled analysis of nine studies that examined effect of oral aloe vera in people with diabetes and pre diabetes. analysis is work of researchers at david grant usaf medical center at travis air force base in fairfield california. they reported their findings in journal of alternative and complementary medicine. in united states authors note nearly 21 million people have diabetes. cost of treatment and loss of productivity in 2012 due to diabetes was 245 billion. global cost is expected to exceed staggering 490 billion by 2030. researchers note data suggest that patients with fbg 200 mg dl may see greater benefit. this group saw average fbg reduction of 109.9 mg dl. more importantly results of this analysis support use of oral aloe vera for significantly reducing both fbg 46.6 mg dl and hba1c 1.05 in prediabetic and diabetic patients. fewer than half of patients with type 2 diabetes have their disease well controlled. however there is need for new affordable and effective medications without unfavorable side effects. estimates are that up to 49 percent of diabetics have taken dietary supplements or used other forms of complementary and alternative medicine in effort to treat their diabetes or other health condition. this recent analysis suggests there should be further investigations of medicinal plant as anti diabetic compound. though aloe vera has wide spectrum of properties and uses some of them could be myths and some of them could be magic. aloe vera does not have just one ingredient that makes it healthful. different compound groups of nutrients work together to make aloe vera plant effective. plant is quite useful across wide spectrum of conditions. various elements that make aloe vera plant so effective are nutrients rather than drugs. juice may complement medicinal treatments. some cancer patients are noted for saying aloe vera plant helps to reduce nausea and increase energy. additionally aloe vera plant may also minimize low blood counts caused by chemotherapy or radiation according to some reports. in future controlled studies are required to prove effectiveness of aloe vera under various conditions. nevertheless aloe vera plant does provide number of health benefits worth noting.,aloe vera plant is used as alternative medicine for variety of adverse health

vegan diet does for people with diabetes. ,while it is still not commonly held in mainstream discourse that humanity could survive and even thrive without some form of monetary exchange more and more people that are starting to trace their general discontent about contemporary society to its source are finding money and profit motive at root of it. perhaps first of knee jerk reactions some people might have to idea of shifting into money free system is sinking feeling of watching their hard earned wealth evaporate into nothingness which they might equate with abject poverty. we are so programmed to equate money with abundance that we do nt understand what abundance truly is. at heart of it our net abundance is shared and is grounded in resources available in nature on planet. aggregate of these natural resources not only represents our potential abundance but our very survival. money system grants ownership to many of these resources and makes it exponentially easier for those with abundance to get more abundance at expense of vast majority of people. money system is in some ways antithetical to proper management and distribution of these resources. without money each individual would naturally be entitled to their share of all resources in world and that would never change. but how would such system work. jacque fresco founder of venus project believes that world has reached level of technology that will allow us to build fully self sustaining communities all over world which when optimally designed will provide not only unimaginably high level of abundance for all its residents but far greater sense of shared purpose within community. this vision is grounded in principles of resource based economy without profit motive individuals within community will naturally turn their energy towards efficient maintenance of infrastructure and problem solving and innovation for collective as happiness and well being of community is naturally equated with ones own happiness and well being. in video below is brief introduction to frescos inspiring vision of our potential future. more information. including where venus project is at on their timeline is available on their website. no need for trade since money is nothing more than medium of exchange it is only in removing convention of exchange or trade itself that then renders money obsolete. that s why resource based economy proposes that all resources must be declared as common heritage of all earths inhabitants. in his tedx talk colin turner really questions idea that trade is only organizational model for life on planet and in fact outlines ways in which trade is actually antithetical to human abundance and well being we all more or less accept trade as being de facto way of operating our society so much so that we even see it as some kind of universal law. but it might surprise you to know actually that trade has only existed in relatively recent years that in 90 of our modern human history we did nt actually trade at all there still are no archaeological traces of trade. in these early tribal agrarian communities what actually happened was there was implied understanding that everyone in tribe looked after each other. and this was how tribes operated for perhaps vast majority of our early human history. so we see trade now as very important way of doing business and you have to say that trade works i get what i want and you get what you want and we all go home happy. but when you actually scratch surface little bit more about how trade actually pans out in real world its not such nice story. it seems to be better theory than actually works out in practice. for example most obvious case is about 3 billion people in world today live on 2.50 or less daymany of them much much less than that. obviously they are wracked with starvation or dying of curable diseases so i mean you have to ask yourself is trade really working for them for those people. clearly it is nt. colin turner is founder of free world charter which currently has 58.611 signatories among people from 215 different countries and would welcome yours if you are so inclined. charter constitutes set of principles that really formalizes notion that all human individuals are entitled to maintain equal share of earths resources but it also outlines natural responsibilities and practices that each individual would assume in order to live optimally and harmoniously together in money free community and world. here are ten principles highest concern of humanity is combined common good of all living species and biosphere. life is precious in all its forms and free to flourish in combined common good. earths natural resources are birthright of all its inhabitants and free to share in combined common good. every human being is equal part of worldwide community of humans and free citizen of earth. our community is founded on spirit of cooperation and understanding of nature provided through basic education. our community provides for all its members necessities of healthy fulfilling and sustainable life freely and without obligation. our community respects limits of nature and its resources ensuring minimal consumption and waste. our community derives its solutions and advances progress primarily through application of logic and best available knowledge. our community acknowledges its duty of care and compassion for members who are unable to contribute. our community acknowledges its responsibility to maintain diverse and sustainable biosphere for all future life to enjoy these are certainly not final words on which principles should truly define future society and world free of money but in reading them one can clearly grasp overall essence of kind of mindset we will need to develop and implement in our lives if we are to shift into this new paradigm. shift we are looking for here is grounded in conscious move by individuals of this planet away from model of competition and towards model of cooperation. we are all quite familiar with both as we surely have ample amount of experience in both ways of relating to people around us. if you could choose right now which kind of model would you want as basis for entire planet. some might argue that competitive trade money paradigm has been instrumental in getting us to make progress especially technologically which we may not have achieved by remaining with cooperative tribal model. there may be some truth in this. but does it not seem that at this time in history most of us have had it with debt scarcity and inequality that is hallmark of money model. are we not hungering for more love cooperation and shared abundance imbued in very organizational structures we create for ourselves to live. understand that making this change is not as simple as going to united nations or other authoritative world body as jacque fresco has already done. presenting compelling vision of future without money to benefit of all of humanity does not automatically mean that world authority will implement it right away. powers behind world authority like un are actually made up of those who have most money. what we see going on in public arena are essentially machinations of puppets they control. this is nothing new. overall system that maintains power by few has been in place ever since money and exchange were introduced. while in past this wealth was protected over generations and generations by certain families who were visible royalty noblemen and aristocracy of day todays world only differs in sense that these powers are more hidden from sight while countries maintain illusion of having some form of democracy. point is that we will never be able to elicit help of our authority if we want to abandon our current money economy. those in authority who at very top own vast percentage of worlds resources certainly believe they would have most to lose if we moved to model founded on equally shared abundance. what we actually need to do is elicit help of each other energizing important movements and fostering awakening as to how powerful we actually are as collective. when critical mass of us begin marching in step to new way of life current authority will have no power to stop us. money free society and world can certainly work from standpoint of creating abundance for everyone on planet. what is needed is new awareness founded on some of natural principles discussed here. more that individuals of planet slowly move away from competitive money centered practices and spend their time and energy cultivating cooperation more quickly we will be able to collectively walk away from system that no longer serves us.,food truly is medicine and nutrition is great way to combat multiple diseases. what s extremely confusing is why so many doctors stillchoose to prescribe medication first without considering power of nutrition. many doctors are not even aware of power of nutrition and its ability to heal diseases and this is probably because.

reduction associated with new onset type 2 diabetes appears to be stronger with caffeinated coffee. if you are looking for another reason to enjoy cup of organic coffee these findings may be of interest to you. coffee has long been one of most widely consumed beverages globally playing central role in diverse cultures around world. since its discovery more than 1.000 years ago in region now known as ethiopia coffee has taken center stage as social icon. you might invite friend or coworker to meet for coffee or join you for coffee break. below are some facts about this popular drink as presented by european coffee federation:2 estimated 2 billion cups of coffee are consumed around world every day coffee is one of most valuable products in world trade and its cultivation marketing processing trading and transportation provide employment for millions of people globally coffee is grown in about 70 countries with small operations producing approximately 80 percent of worlds coffee supply brazil is largest producer of coffee contributing 40 percent of worlds supply followed by vietnam with 16 percent about this ubiquitous beverage european coffee federation says.3 coffee is one of most extensively researched components in diet. taken overall research indicates that moderate coffee consumption can be part of healthy balanced diet for general adult population and may even confer health benefits.4 global rates of diabetes chronic disease that arises when your pancreas does not produce enough insulin or your body can not effectively use insulin it produces continue to skyrocket. according to world health organization who number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014.5 who notes prevalence of diabetes which is major cause of blindness heart attacks lower limb amputation kidney failure and stroke has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle income countries. they estimate diabetes was seventh leading cause of death in 2016 and its prevalence has been steadily increasing for past 30 years.6 according to report by u.s. centers for disease control and prevention cdc).7 around 30.3 million americans had diabetes in 2015 with 7.2 million of those cases going undiagnosed. they note type 2 diabetes is most common form of disease accounting for 90 to 95 percent of all cases. with increasing numbers of people suffering from diabetes researchers are investigating every possible prevention strategy including consumption of coffee. coffee drinking found to slash your risk of type 2 diabetes given skyrocketing rates of diabetes worldwide news of positive association between coffee drinking and potential lower risk of type 2 diabetes is noteworthy. based on meta analysis of 30 prospective studies conducted between 2002 and 2015 researchers from swedens karolinska institutet suggest coffee consumption is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes risk.8 analysis which pooled data from nearly 1.2 million participants featured 53.018 type 2 diabetes cases. pair of researchers found risk of type 2 diabetes was 29 percent less within highest coffee consumption group median consumption was 5 cups per day as compared to lowest coffee consumption group median consumption was zero cups per day. beyond that they suggest risk of type 2 diabetes decreased by 6 percent for each cup per day increase in coffee consumption. results were similar for caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee. study authors stated:9 health benefits of coffee compounds like cafestol research continues to call out certain compounds in coffee that are responsible for its health boosting properties. 2017 study published in journal of natural products.10 for example suggests cafestol bioactive compound found in coffee improved type 2 diabetes markers in research involving lab mice fed daily dose of compound. results were summarized as follows:11.12 groups fed either 0.4 or 1.1 milligrams of cafestol experienced 28 to 30 percent reduction in blood glucose levels compared to control group mice fed higher dose of cafestol reflected 42 percent improvement in insulin sensitivity compared to control group mice fed higher dose of cafestol showed 20 percent reduction in fasting glucagon hormone responsible for increasing blood glucose levels at end of 10-week study period scientists isolated islets of langerhans pancreatic cells that normally produce insulin from each group of mice. as compared to control group they found islets isolated from mice fed cafestol were associated with 75 to 87 percent increase in insulin production. about outcomes study authors stated our results show cafestol possesses antidiabetic properties. consequently cafestol may contribute to reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes in coffee consumers and has potential role as antidiabetic drug.13 about many beneficial compounds found in coffee team from karolinska institutet stated:14 increasing your coffee intake by just 1 cup day can make big difference 2014 study published in journal diabetologia15 suggests increasing your coffee intake may reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes whereas increase in tea consumption had no effect on diabetes risk. researchers examined associations among changes in coffee and tea consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes as evaluated during four year study period. data was provided from 48.464 women involved in nurses health study 1986 to 2006 47.510 women in nurses health study ii 1991 to 2007 and 27.759 men in health professionals follow up study 1986 to 2006. diet was assessed every four years using validated food frequency questionnaire and self reported cases of type 2 diabetes were validated through supplementary questionnaires. in all three cohorts researchers collected detailed information on diet lifestyle medical conditions and other chronic diseases every two to four years for more than 20 years. having documented 7.269 cases of type 2 diabetes scientists found participants who increased their coffee consumption by more than 1 cup per day median change 1.69 cups per day over four year period had 11 percent lower risk of type 2 diabetes in subsequent four years compared with those who made no changes in their consumption participants who decreased their coffee intake by more than 1 cup per day median change was minus 2 cups per day experienced 17 percent higher risk of type 2 diabetes changes in tea consumption were not associated with type 2 diabetes risk our findings confirm those of previous studies that showed higher coffee consumption was associated with lower type 2 diabetes risk said lead author shilpa bhupathiraju research fellow in department of nutrition at harvard school of public health hsph. most importantly they provide new evidence that changes in coffee consumption habit can affect type 2 diabetes risk in relatively short period of time.16 added senior author dr. frank hu chair of department of nutrition at hsph these findings further demonstrate that for most people coffee may have health benefits but coffee is only one of many factors that influence diabetes risk. more importantly individuals should watch their weight and be physically active.17 health benefits of coffee extend from your heart to your brain research presented at american heart association 's scientific sessions 2017 found that compared to noncoffee drinkers coffee drinkers were observed to have 7 percent lower risk of heart failure and 8 percent lower risk of stroke for each additional cup of coffee consumed per week.18 authors of 2017 meta analysis published in bmj noted coffee consumption of 3 to 4 cups day versus none had nonlinear association to reduce your risk of:19 in addition high versus low coffee consumption was associated with 18 percent lower risk of cancer. scientists added consumption was also associated with lower risk of several specific cancers and neurological metabolic and liver conditions.20 as noted in video

serious condition that becomes more widespread each year. ironically many people do nt actually know cause of diabetes or risk factors that can develop disorder. disease pertains to severe abnormality of human metabolism way in which our bodies use digested food for energy. there are several ways in which diabetes can manifest itself within human body these include type 1 type 2 as well as gestational diabetes. those who have type 1 are most times born with ailment while type 2 diabetes can unfortunately manifest at any point in time throughout ones life. lets take closer look at symptoms diabetic may incur and how you can reduce your risk of ever being diagnosed with diabetes and many other health complications through simple lifestyle changes. who is at risk for diabetes. as previously discussed this type usually begins at or shortly after birth. in this case pancreas is permanently unable to create insulin. this is life long condition that must be treated daily. main factors associated with this type include first and foremost family history of type 1 diabetes. if any direct relative has type 1 diabetes you are at higher risk of all forms of diabetes. additionally diseases of pancreas such as pancreatitis gallstones or pancreatic cancer at some point during your life your bodys ability to produce insulin will slow dramatically and can lead to diabetes. and lastly certain infection or illness can temporarily or permanently damage your pancreas. in case of type 2 diabetes your body can in fact produce insulin but is unable to utilize said insulin effectively. this is known as insulin resistance. type 2 is most common in adults affecting nearly 30 million individuals worldwide. it can begin at any time in your life and is becoming more prevalent in pre teens and teenagers due to childhood obesity. leading contributor to type 2 diabetes is predominantly obesity. research has shown that excessive inactivity due to sedentary lifestyles during childhood is having most lasting effect than ever before. if you are obese you are also at high risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure. other factors that could put you at risk of diabetes include but are not limited to age ethnic background and family history. gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy gestation. like other types of diabetes it affects how your cells use sugar glucose. gestational diabetes causes high blood sugar that can actually affect your pregnancy and your baby 's health if left untreated. what are symptoms. there are very serious warning signs of diabetes that should alert you to seek medical attention immediately. when your body becomes unable to adequately produce insulin you need to be prescribed insulin pump to manually inject your body with hormone. common symptoms include but are not limited to increased thirst and hunger especially after eating dry mouth frequent urination or urine infections unexplained weight loss and fatigue. patients with type 1 diabetes manage their condition by taking insulin multiple times day since their body is unable to produce enough insulin on its own. those with type 2 diabetes may also need to take insulin regularly or in certain situations like during pregnancy or hospitalization. conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis sometimes develop in patients who have type 1 diabetes but have yet to be diagnosed. it can also occur with those who have type 1 diabetes develop infection injury illness or when they miss insulin dosage. symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include head and stomach pain nausea vomiting rapid breathing reduced alertness and dry skin. depending on severity type 2 diabetes patients may be able to maintain their health through well balanced diet and regular physical activity. these treatments also help with gestational diabetes in pregnant women. doctor may prescribe medication like invokana or another sglt2 inhibitor to be combined with insulin treatment and healthy lifestyle choices. invokana reduces blood sugar by blocking glucose from being reabsorbed into blood. effectiveness of drug comes at price however as hazardous side effects of invokana can be just as bad as symptoms it is intended to treat. lower limb amputation and fourniers gangrene have both been cited in patients using invokana. class action suits have helped those who have suffered to gain monetary rewards to compensate their pain and suffering. metformin is another example of sglt2 inhibitor that may cause extensive health risks. this november as it has been delegated as national diabetes awareness month be on lookout for symptoms previously discussed of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. if you are pregnant consult with your physician regarding your risks of gestational diabetes. protect you and your loved ones against type 2 diabetes by staying active eating well balanced diet and getting

today.,diabetes mellitus is group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels over prolonged period resulting from defects in insulin secretion insulin action or both. uncontrolled blood glucose levels would typically lead to raised blood glucose levels termed as chronic hyperglycemia. chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long term complications due to oxidative damage which is thought to cause dysfunction and failure of various organs especially eyes kidneys heart nerves and blood vessels. resulting ailments diseases caused by oxidative damage can always be major concern for diabetics and their caregivers since they are debilitating in nature thus diabetes is termed as degenerative disease. several factors can contribute to hyperglycemia in diabetics including food and physical activity choices illnesses nondiabetes medications or skipping or not taking enough glucose lowering medication for those depending solely on anti diabetic drugs. controlling blood glucose at all time should be top priority for diabetics. following nutritious foods are believed to be beneficial when included in your diabetes diet to help lower blood sugar reduce inflammation and gain other health benefits including slowing down oxidative damage. certain variety of white skin and flesh sweet potato caiapo has been suggested to improve diabetic symptoms in individuals with type 2 diabetes. studies have found that caiapo sweet potato may decrease fasting blood glucose and ldl cholesterol levels as well as increase insulin sensitivity. in usa you can use beauregard variety of sweet potatoes which makes up about 85 percent of production in north carolina are said to contain essentially same protein patterns as commercial dietary supplement known as caiapo. study found glycemic index of raw skin and boiled flesh of beauregard variety of sweet potatoes to be about 31. note other varieties including orange and purple ones are not be suitable as their glycemic indices are high. mix thoroughly equal parts of ground organic soybean brown rice and corn in bowl. take teaspoonful with water twice daily. mixture is thought to help control blood glucose levels in diabetics. studies are not available at this moment to back suggestion. still even though it is based on anecdotal evidence no harm for you to try. glucose lowering effect of mixture might due to synergistic effects of various nutrients including proteins vitamins and minerals. studies have shown that both cinnamon and clove can help lower blood glucose in diabetics. mix equal parts of cinnamon dan clove. take teaspoon with water twice daily. herbs may also help improve lipid profile triglycerides ldl hdl total cholesterol. some people may experience dry throat after taking mixture and feel warm all over body. take suggested dose of mixture along with teaspoon of gotu kola which also possesses anti diabetic activity. prolonged used of gotu kola is said to help improve lipid profile too. teaspoonful of virgin coconut oil vco taken first thing in morning is believed to help control blood glucose levels in diabetics. mechanism how it does that is not known. take teaspoonful of vco twice daily. one of proposed mechanisms for formation of diabetes type 2 is downregulation cell membranes produce fewer insulin receptors of insulin receptors resulting from high insulin levels hyperinsulinemia which in turn cause cells to produce fewer glut4 glucose transporter type 4 responsible for bringing in glucose into cells. thus regular vco intakes can possibly repair this impaired mechanism first by joining other lipids to become part of lipid bi layer structure. this may result in process of upregulating cell membranes produce more insulin receptors of insulin receptors consequently more glut4 is produced by cell. more glut4 is produced more glucose is taken in into cell. smoothies consists of half boiled broccoli unripe banana with peel also half boiled and other green vegetables optional can also be very helpful in controlling blood glucose levels. take cup twice daily. at same time you may also take cup of fresh milk or coconut milk. studies in diabetics have indicated that broccoli may reduce insulin levels and protect cells from harmful free radicals resulting from metabolism. as for unripe banana it offers low glycemic index as it contains less sugar and more resistance starch. resistance starches are long chain glucose resistant to digestion in upper part of your digestive system. even microbiota in small intestine can not metabolize it. however good news is microbiota in your large intestine can convert resistance starches into invaluable chemicals including butyrates which is used as fuel that provides energy for epithelial cells of colon colonocytes. studies have demonstrated that feeding resistant starch to microbiota may be linked to improved metabolic health hence resulting in blood sugar control. in fact latest research finding based on study on blood sugar control in women with type 2 diabetes has indicated some interesting results participants supplementing with resistant starch had better blood sugar control than those who did nt over 8-week period. in my opinion therefore unripe banana together with its peel can possibly have bright future as agent to control high blood glucose in diabetics.,hyperglycemia in diabetics can be controlled by using natural therapies such as using right foods that have anti diabetic glucose lowering activities.

breakthrough discovery shows that resonant frequencies can kill cancer cells heart disease disorders diabetes pain and many more. alternative before it 's news. ,new breakthrough discovery shows that resonant frequencies can kill cancer cells heart disease disorders diabetes pain and many more. of readers think this story is fact. add your two cents. new breakthrough discovery shows that resonant frequencies can kill cancer cells heart disease disorders diabetes pain and many more. important breakthrough may prevent people from suffering from cancer or aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments used to kill cancer cells. lawrence gilligan and his fellow researchers at common sense technologies discovered that by creating custom digital electronic signals they can destroy cancer cells and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus msra. in their experiments team used oscillating pulsed electric fields opef to induce sympathetic resonant vibrations which in short amount of time shattered targeted cells from pancreatic cancer leukemia ovarian cancer and dangerous antibiotic resistant bacterium msra. below is image showing effect that resonant frequencies had on leukemia cells. just as various sound frequencies can shatter different types of crystal and glass shattering microscopic organisms is possible because they have many similar properties of liquid crystals. common sense technologies uses allows their clients to use any standard computer ipad or smartphone to emit right frequency electronic signals to induce sympathetic resonant vibration in targeted microorganisms. additionally their research showed that not only can one change vibration of biological living microorganism with electronic signal but also that different frequencies of this electronic signal can be used to target different types of microorganisms. below is more detailed information and contact information. common sense technologies also known as frequency doctors say they have developed method to calculate exact frequency that it would take to shake virus to death. their researchers have discovered that when viruses are bombarded with correct frequency pulses they shake apart. this arises from inherent characteristic of all objects called resonant frequency which is frequency at which object naturally vibrates. resonant frequencies are key to stringed instruments in which string of certain material thickness and length has resonant frequency that produces specific musical note. but resonant frequencies can also cause objects to shake so uncontrollably that their stability is undermined as when wind shook tacoma narrows bridge at its resonant frequency in 1940 causing it to collapse. because shell of single virus can contain millions of atoms it is difficult to calculate given virus resonant frequency except by trial and error. but in current study researchers successfully calculated resonant frequency of or several viruses illnesses diseases and conditions. vibrational treatments have number of benefits over chemical approaches. first of all while many drugs are very harsh on body and have dangerous or debilitating side effects frequencies used to disrupt viruses should have no effect on human or even bacterial cells which are much larger and consequently have significantly lower resonant frequencies. in addition because resonant frequency is inherent characteristic of virus makeup researchers say it is unlikely that resistance to it could develop. life of rife did he discover cure for cancer. in latter half of 1990s decade orthodox medical system imploded. new forms of healing suddenly were chosen by huge segments of american people while drug medicine surgery and endless high technology diagnostics were increasingly rejected. from this amazing shift to blood cleansing herbal cures acupuncture energy body stimulation and active physical and mental participation of patient in healing process came revival of various lost or suppressed discoveries from other times. among most outstanding was one based on discoveries of royal r. rife lost genius of san diego. rife was brilliant scientist born in late 1800s. after studying at johns hopkins rife developed bioelectric medicine technology that is still commonly used today in fields of optics electronics radiochemistry biochemistry ballistics and aviation. he received 14 major awards and honors and was given honorary doctorate by university of heidelberg for his work. in 1930s rife invented super microscope that used light in revolutionary design. it enabled him to see virus size microbe invisible to naked eye that could not even be seen with electron microscope. more important unlike electron microscopes microbe remained alive. he found that every micro organism has mortal oscillatory rate point at which it will shatter or break apart when bombarded by sound waves like intense musical note that shatters glass. he discovered microbe that caused or at minimum was deeply involved with. once frequency for cancer linked microbe was identified it was simple step to test his world shaking discovery on mice and then move to clinical treatment of supposedly terminal cancer patients. in 1934 rife and team of doctors and scientists from leading medical research facilities cured 16 out of 16 cancer patients using frequency machine. over next four years instruments and methods were refined. some of north americas most brilliant cancer researchers visited rifes laboratory and became involved in secret research committee at u.s.c. clinical proof of successful and painless cures from cancer and other microbe caused diseases increased as clinics in los angeles and san diego slowly documented cases. additional laboratory verification came from research institutions in san francisco chicago new jersey and montreal. by late 1930s energy medicine doctors using variety of different electronic approaches grew in numbers and had formed national associations. however threat to orthodox medicine was too great. without any consideration for their hippocratic oaths or well being of people medical officials and societies mounted furious counterattack against rifes monumental discovery before american public could be informed of it. doctors who were using rifes instruments to treat cancer and other diseases were threatened with losing their licenses and being thrown into jail. most meekly surrendered. energy medicine laboratory complex which was in process of verifying rifes discoveries was mysteriously burned while owner was in california visiting rife. rife was hauled into court prevented from leaving for england where leading scientists were prepared to establish independent testing facility to substantiate great discovery and distribute his unique instruments worldwide. all medical journals were censored and one of greatest scientific and medical discoveries of 20th century was ruthlessly shoved into dungeon of history. in late 1980s evolutionary shift slowly began to unfold throughout world. bio energetic subtle energy interactions of human body became serious research area in leading universities private medical research facilities and government agencies nasa. grassroots interest in alternative medicine simultaneously erupted to confront drug medicine practitioners with their failures and expense. from information whirlwind spurred by internet and information democracy new interest has emerged in royal r. rifes extraordinary cures lost 60 years ago. just over horizon lies awakening of mainstream america and possibly delivery of rifes lost discoveries to be integrated into strikingly different 21st century healing model enabling natural painless inexpensive methods of curing many diseases. dr. milbank johnson of university of southern california organizes clinical trial consisting of 16 persons with cancer diagnosed as terminal what became of rife technology. after completing his microscope he spent most of 1920s in this pursuit. working with cancerous tissue confirmed by lab analysis to be malignant rife found what he deemed to be guilty microbe and injected it into mice. when they then developed cancer he removed their cancerous tumors and in them once again found same microbe. during summer of 1934 16 terminal cancer patients sat few feet away from rifes machine for three minutes every third day. after 90 days 15 were declared fully recovered by attending physicians and in another month other ones as well. in nutshell that is essence of rife story microscope that could see virus size microbes which best electron microscopes can not see in their live state and frequency emitting ray tube capable of killing microbe which caused human cancer thus enabling cancer patients to recover. this story fired up christopher bird to write his 1976 article five years after rife died at age 83 forgotten man article revived some interest in rifes work but was largely ignored. then bird showed article to independent scholar journalist barry lynes who urged bird to write book on rife. bird researching for his secrets of soil told barry result was lynes comprehensive cancer cure that worked which triggered rife revival. then came royal rife report by borderland sciences and later rife way by late dallas researcher mark simpson. article by dr. r. e. seidel and elizabeth winter entitled new microscopes published in february 1944 journal of franklin institute and later reprinted in smithsonian annual report contains great deal of information on how rife microscope worked and about research done with it. what has happened now my thoughts as one of founders of common sense technologies were and always have been was perhaps world will someday rediscover one of greatest gifts on which it has ever turned its back. someday we may develop equipment or technology similar to rife ray machine. then and only then through elimination of disease conditions and organisms mankind will live healthier happier and longer life. so i made it focal point in my life especially when both my mother and father passed away from cancer and during that time i had to see them suffer as medical community claimed they were doing everything known to man to help. so after years of research i compiled list of proven frequencies used by rife. separated them into several categories depending on effectiveness of disease illness condition ect. however hardest part was to be able to submit them more than one frequency at time. because rife was only able to give one frequency at time it became time consuming having to sit hours day on machine to receive treatments. so pain stakenly i creator and wrote program to do just that. now we administer between 48 to 96 frequencies simultaneously setting us apart from everyone making us leader. dr. rife right now is looking down upon us at this time with biggest grin he has because he knew 70 years ago what could ultimately be achieved with right technology. unfortunately he died praying that technology would someday be available. contact fr. gerald j. giunta frequency mds symptom analyst or lawrence gilligan genius behind technology for your free consultation about your symptoms and they will be glad to explain to you why you can start using frequencies even if you ve already begun treatments from physician. i hope you realize that frequency medicine can treat anything that is wrong with you even if there is no diagnosis and when you eliminate symptom you cure disease. we have been receiving many many orders from countries that already use one frequency technology on regular basis as well as america. they are safe to use in any situation because they do nt disrupt functions they do nt cause symptoms and they do nt interfere with medications or treatments under any circumstances. we also have pain frequencies and all of other rx drug frequencies except they are nt addictive.

nutrition and exercise avoiding lifetime of insulin and toxic pharma drugs two decades ago i was on path to lifetime of type-2 diabetes. living on processed foods and lacking exercise i suffered from hypoglycemia high cholesterol and numerous other health problems. like millions of people have now achieved however i turned my health around with simple but powerful changes in food nutrition and exercise. in doing that i learned something medical establishment has long sought to prevent people from realizing type-2 diabetes can be prevented reversed and cured in most but not all cases. its not even very difficult in most cases especially when addressed in its early stages. type-2 diabetes is nt really disease in classic sense its just physiological cause and effect. symptoms of diabetes in other words have causes. and if you remove those causes you halt symptoms and no longer have disease at all. this simple realization remains completely taboo in medical establishment today which continues to absurdly insist that disease occur spontaneously without cause in violation of basic laws of universe. over last 15 years through natural news and other sites like prevention.news i ve helped tens of millions of other people learn about healing foods nutrition and reversing disease. yet incessant propaganda of processed food industry and anti science lies of medical establishment continue to deprive masses of simple knowledge they need to eliminate type-2 diabetes for life. this is all by design of course. pharma drug cartels do nt profit from people being well. they only profit from ongoing sickness and disease. to them diabetes is business model. its same story with cancer alzheimers and many other diseases and symptoms. already drug industry has figured out how to generate billions year in revenue by tricking people into thinking they need to treat numbers such as high blood pressure numbers or cholesterol numbers. numbers themselves become disease and toxic drugs are deemed to be successes based solely on whether they alter those numbers. yet artificial alterations of those numbers is medically useless. nearly entire pharmaceutical industry is grand medical hoax. discover world without diabetes we already know solutions right now we could all be living in world that s largely free of type-2 diabetes yet medical establishment big pharma and fda does not want that world to materialize. it would render their profits and power obsolete. so they trap people in system of contrived medical ignorance combined with monopolistic pushing of toxic high profit pharmaceuticals to treat their symptoms without ever solving underlying health problems that causes those symptoms in first place. that s why pharmaceutical medicine is failure. system is collapsing. disease is progressing like never before and cities states and entire nations are going bankrupt forking money over to big pharma in misguided effort to senselessly treat symptoms with pharma chemicals that simply do nt work. fortunately real solutions are now available to public through independent media. this week powerful new documentary series was released that can revolutionize health education and help eradicate type-2 diabetes forever. that docu series called ithrive is available right now and can be watched tonight and this weekend. watch my sneak peek interview below and click here to register to watch all other episodes this weekend. this video series will give you knowledge that i used to defeat trajectory of type-2 diabetes that would have made me pharma slave for life. if i beat type-2 diabetes you can too. all you need is proper knowledge same knowledge for profit diabetes industry deliberately withholds from public in order to protect its own profits. reversing type-2 diabetes is easier than you think. simple but powerful changes in food choice nutrition and low intensity exercise can literally save your life and eliminate this disease from your physiology. this can free you from lifetime of drug dependence and expensive doctor visits. to protect its profits pharmaceutical industry absolutely does not want you to learn this information because if entire nation learned these secrets diabetes treatment industry would collapse overnight and people would get healthier which is precisely what pharmaceutical industry does nt want.,by mike

sugary soda that adds to u.s. diabetes problem hits all time low. ,carbonated soda pop provides more added sugar in typical 2-year old toddler 's diet than cookies candies and ice cream combined. good news is that soda consumption in united states fell to 31-year low in 2016 new figures reveal. sales of carbonated soft drinks dipped 0.8 percent last year according to research from beverage digest. and it 's not just sodas that are taking hit. data show sale of fruit juices sugary drinks and even diet beverages are at all time low. these low numbers come as obesity in america has spiked and more information has entered market about health risks related to sugar packed drinks. instead of reaching for soda data shows people are drinking trendy sugar free drinks like sparkling water pre bottled coffee and sports drinks. rates of diabetes in united states are currently at all time high and sugary drinks are one of main contributors. consider hard facts about soft drinks soda consumption could lead to various health problems. related article scientific look at how soda destroys your body video one very recent independent peer reviewed study demonstrates strong link between soda consumption and childhood obesity. one previous industry supported unpublished study showed no link. explanations of mechanism by which soda may lead to obesity have not yet been proved though evidence for them is strong. many people have long assumed that soda high in calories and sugar low in nutrients can make kids fat. but until this month there was no solid scientific evidence demonstrating this. reporting in lancet british medical journal team of harvard researchers presented first evidence linking soft drink consumption to childhood obesity. they found that 12-year olds who drank soft drinks regularly were more likely to be overweight than those who did n't. for each additional daily serving of sugar sweetened soft drink consumed during nearly two year study risk of obesity increased 1.6 times. obesity experts called harvard findings important and praised study for being prospective. in other words harvard researchers spent 19 months following children rather than capturing snapshot of data from just one day. it 's considered statistically more valuable to conduct study over long period of time. researchers found that schoolchildren who drank soft drinks consumed almost 200 more calories per day than their counterparts who did n't down soft drinks. that finding helps support notion that we do n't compensate well for calories in liquid form. beverage consumption in most developed countries of world is now major contributor of tooth decay. it 's one health effect that even soft drink industry admits grudgingly has merit. in carefully worded statement nsda says that there 's no scientific evidence that consumption of sugars per se has any negative effect other than dental caries. but association also correctly notes that soft drinks are n't sole cause of tooth decay. in fact lot of sugary foods from fruit juices to candy and even raisins and other dried fruit have what dentists refer to as cariogenic properties which is to say they can cause tooth decay. okay so how many more cavities are soft drink consumers likely to get compared with people who do n't drink soda. this is where it gets complicated. federally funded study of nearly 3.200 americans 9 to 29 years old conducted between 1971 and 1974 showed direct link between tooth decay and soft drinks. numerous other studies have shown same link throughout world from sweden to iraq. but sugar is n't only ingredient in soft drinks that causes tooth problems. acids in soda pop are also notorious for etching tooth enamel in ways that can lead to cavities. acid begins to dissolve tooth enamel in only 20 minutes notes ohio dental association in release issued earlier this month. as more information has become available for consumers about how to slim down and stay healthy americans have started cutting down on things like soda and fast foods. but decrease in sales has n't hurt companies like coca cola or pepsi co as demand for lower calorie products like trendy sparkling water coffee and tea is at all time high. drinks like bottled waters and value added sparkling or flavored waters made up for drop in soda sales. people are increasingly becoming aware of downside of soda drinking stemming from high sugar and calorie content of regular soda and concerns surrounding health impact of artificial sweeteners used in diet soda karen ansel ms rdn author of healing superfoods for anti aging stay younger live longer stated. as result many people are seeking out more natural and healthful beverages which likely explains why bottled water sales now outpace soda sales she explained. since 2004 market for soda has decreased by 1.6 billion cases according to beverage digest report obtained by fortune. in last year steepest decline was seen in sale of diet pepsi which fell by 9.2 percent and diet coke 4.3 percent. though both drinks still rank among top 10 most popular soft drinks in america. that plunge in sales is due to increased skepticism of artificial sweeteners particularly aspartame. this data also comes as western diet which is characterized by high fat and high sugar meals has come under attack by nutritionists as cause for numerous health problems including diabetes heart disease and even certain cancers. politicians in united states are currently pushing for new nation wide soda tax in attempt to cut sales of sugary soft drinks even further and improve national health. first soda tax went into effect in california in april and cut drink sales by 10 percent clear sign that move could help in fight against obesity. state was following in footsteps of mexico which saw similar drop in soda consumption thanks to sugar tax. in mexico country with serious and escalating diabetes rates soda sales dropped by six percent in 2014 after tax rise and 10 percent price hike. experts estimated that cutting soda consumption by just 20 percent could save up to 23.6 billion in healthcare costs over 10 years. soda drinking among high school students in us dropped by over one third from 2007 to 2015. meanwhile there has been uptick in number of american children drinking diet soda. is soda industry hiding health risks of drinking soda. researchers say new figures are encouraging as sugar sweetened beverages are one of largest contributors of added sugars to adolescents diets. however they noted that overall prevalence of americans drinking sugary drinks at any age remains high and more approaches need to be put into place for downward trend to continue. report as part of cdc 's weekly morbidity and mortality report took its data from yrbs us survey that provides representative data on health behaviors among students in grades nine to 12. survey asked high schoolers how many times that had drunk can bottle or glass of soda or pop such as coke pepsi or sprite and not counting diet drinks. researchers found that number of students drinking soda daily had significantly fallen from 33.8 percent in 2007 to 20.4 percent in 2015.,sugary sodas are big problem in u.s. but at least their popularity is declining.

demonstrable nonsense defies belief. impetus behind study is this. 2015 study of eight adults eight who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes found that after they had spent 10 days in moderately cold weather they had improved metabolism and thus became more sensitive to insulin which helped reverse key disease symptoms. and in 2016 study researchers claimed to have discovered correlation between outside ambient temperature and blood sugar measurement hba1c when temperatures were higher so too was blood sugar. well these two findings led dutch researchers to ponder whether climate change might be partially responsible for rise in worldwide diabetes cases from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million by 2014. using centers for disease control data on prevalence of diabetes in all 50 states between 1996 and 2013 and average temperature data for each state during same period obtained from national centers for environmental information they concluded that higher average temperatures in particular time and place times noted higher age adjusted incidence of diabetes. support our mission and enhance your own self reliance laboratory verified organic emergency survival bucket

humanity but controlling it. that s just utterly amazing. never mind dramatic rise in obesity during that same period which researchers claimed to have factored in. nope. its warmer temperatures that are causing more diabetes. now mind you these researchers discuss their findings from standpoint that human caused global warming climate change is already settled when its not. so in their minds humans are essentially causing increase in cases of diabetes because we are affecting global weather patterns and making earth hotter. chelsea clinton is not stupid and neither are researchers who did these studies. but manner in which they come to their conclusions is flawed because they are based on falsehood. it very well may be that higher incidence of diabetes is seen in regions where even slightly warmer average temperatures exist. but that does nt prove that humans are cause of warming and b it does nt rule out other possibilities like maybe people spending more time outdoors indulging in bad eating and drinking habits in warmer weather. we just do nt know. but we do know that so much of data has been faked that its impossible to take conclusions like these at face value.

another risk for kids on antidepressants higher chance of developing type-2 diabetes according to new study.,natural news antidepressants are often prescribed for individuals who exhibit signs of major depressive disorders and various conditions such as anxiety chronic pain and sleep disorders. now recent study has proven that children and adolescents who take antidepressants could develop type-2 diabetes. researchers from university of maryland school of pharmacy and university of maryland school of medicine have discovered that prolonged and current intake of major class of antidepressant medications called serotonin reuptake inhibitors sri can cause estimated two fold increased risk of developing type-2 diabetes in both children and adolescents. teenagers that formerly used and eventually discontinued their medication were not at risk. related study antidepressant drugs actually cause many people to have worse depression. study was published on oct. 16 in jama pediatrics and is first population based study that looked into risks of pediatric patients being diagnosed with type-2 diabetes once they start taking antidepressants. mehmet burcu phd led study for his dissertation. burcu said antidepressants are one of most commonly used psychotropic medication classes among youth in united states with serotonin reuptake inhibitors representing majority of total antidepressant use in this population. he added these findings provide new information on risk of rare but serious adverse outcome that is often difficult to assess in clinical trials due to limited sample size and inadequate follow up. burcu et al. studied medicaid administrative claim files for estimated 120.000 children and adolescents aged five to 20 from california florida illinois and new jersey. children began using antidepressant between january 1 2005 and december 31 2009 and were diagnosed with conditions like depressive disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorders. medication administered to them included serotonin reuptake inhibitors tricyclic or other cyclic antidepressants and other antidepressants. researchers used rigorous design and statistical approaches to cross reference incident cases of diabetes in current antidepressant users to former users as opposed to non users or children and teenagers who were never prescribed antidepressant. burcu shared this approach represented methodological strength of our study as comparison of current users to non users could potentially lead to biased estimates due to several factors such as confounding by indication and medical care utilization intensity bias. julie zito bspharm phd is co author on study. she also acted as burcus advisor. talking about study zito revealed that she was proud of burcus use of complicated methods to determine whether antidepressant use in children increased their risk for developing type-2 diabetes. zito added nested cohort approach that he employed offers fair comparison of those children who are currently using antidepressant versus those children who previously used antidepressant. it helps reduces bias in research which is often challenge with safety studies such as this. during study team found 233 incident cases of type-2 diabetes. at least 156 of these cases occurred while children were taking psychiatric drugs while 77 occurred among with former use of antidepressants. this meant that current use of antidepressants in children and adolescents was related to two fold increased risk of developing type-2 diabetes. daniel j. safer md associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at johns hopkins university school of medicine also shared his thoughts on results of study. he mentioned that antidepressants have more pronounced effect on children who were given higher doses of antidepressants for longer period. safer concluded we know that long term use of these antidepressants is not without risk and further research on outcomes especially for current long term users is warranted to assure favorable benefit risk balance for patients. other side effects of antidepressants aside from causing type-2 diabetes in some adolescents antidepressants have other side effects. according to article on everyday health these side effects include migraine headaches people with depression also often have migraines and individuals that take medication for migraines have to make sure that this wo nt cause serotonin syndrome when taken with sris. serotonin syndrome can cause flushing rapid heart rate and headaches if these two medications are taken at same time. physical symptoms antidepressants they can experience mild and temporary physical sleep disturbance antidepressants can also make it difficult to fall asleep or people can wake up easily at night.,

medical and chronic condition characterized by abnormally high levels of sugar glucose in blood caused by pancreas inability in produced insulin. in other words diabetes is result of absence or insufficient production of insulin by pancreas. condition is also caused by inability of body to properly use of insulin leading to insulin resistance. according to statistic produced by canadian diabetes association approximately 17 of canadian over 12 years of age are diagnosed with diabetes. interestingly diabetes affects both genders up to age 64. prevalence does not increase significantly for those aged 65 and older. unlike type 1 diabetes which is caused by immune system attacking cells in pancreas that make insulin leading to body without enough insulin to function normally type 2 diabetes is caused by unhealthy diet and life style. obesity and increasing age are 2 of many risk factors that can elevate risk of type 2 diabetes. symptoms of type 1 and 2 diabetes according to medicine net include increased urine output excessive thirst weight loss hunger fatigue skin problems slow healing wounds yeast infections .. and tingling or numbness in feet or toes(6. if you

""gestational diabetes refers to high levels of blood sugar that occur during pregnancy and return to normal levels soon after delivery. technically women whose type 1 or type 2 diabetes is first diagnosed during pregnancy should not be considered to have gestational diabetes although in practice many healthcare providers fail to make this distinction.a certain level of elevated blood sugar is normal effect of pregnancy and not cause for concern. excessively high levels however may damage unborn child.gestational diabetes can almost always be controlled with diet and exercise.in new study researchers examined pregnancy records from nichd fetal growth studies singleton cohort which included 468 obese women and 2.334 non obese women. participants completed depression screening questionnaire at between eight and 13 weeks of pregnancy then another between 16th and 22nd weeks and final one six weeks after delivery. researchers also reviewed women 's medical records for diagnoses of gestational diabetes.the researchers found that women who had highest depression scores in first two trimesters of pregnancy approximately 17 percent of participants were nearly three times more likely to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes than women who were less depressed.this means that minor depression was not particularly associated with gestational diabetes of particular note persistent depression from first to second trimester set women at even greater risk for gestational diabetes senior author cuilin zhang said.a surprising finding was that link between depression and gestational diabetes only existed for non obese women even though obese women are significantly more likely to develop gestational diabetes. ""our results suggest it would be good idea for clinicians to pay particular attention to women with high depression scores when evaluating risk of gestational diabetes zhang said.the study also found that women diagnosed with gestational diabetes were more than four times as likely to develop postpartum depression than women without gestational diabetes.however usefulness of this study may be limited by poor clinical practice.currently american college of obstetricians and gynecologists only recommends that pregnant women be screened for depression once between 22 weeks of pregnancy and seven days after birth that is too late to detect gestational diabetes risk and too early to detect postpartum depression.another potential limitation to study 's significance is that gestational diabetes may be wildly over diagnosed due to faulty testing methods and failure to take into account natural insulin resistance that develops during pregnancy.postpartum depression might actually be caused in part by gestational diabetes diagnosis which places women at higher risk of more potentially unnecessary and dangerous birth interventions.a higher intervention birth is known risk factor for postpartum depression.postpartum depression is common and dangerous condition that places women at greater risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide and may also affect well being of their children. due to poor testing practices and lack of support however it is dramatically under diagnosed.",link found between diabetes and depression in pregnant women.

trace minerals may be most beneficial to diabetes patients. it 's so it makes body 's own insulin production go further.if you have diabetes or blood sugar disorders you need to know about chromium. we 've assembled large collection of quotes for you right here but at same time we encourage you to check with your naturopathic physician before beginning chromium supplementation so that you can get full review of your diet supplements and blood sugar situation.here 's collection of quotes from many of top health authors writing today ... both celiac disease and diabetes are major contributors to epidemic of magnesium deficiency and chromium deficiency. up to 90 percent of americans and canadians consume less than minimal 50 micrograms of chromium day. it follows that celiacs eating normal diet would be profoundly chromium deficient. chromium deficiency is associated with 1. hyperglycemia 2. hyperinsulinism insulin resistance 3. insulin dependent diabetes iddm type 1 4. adult onset diabetes niddm type 2 5. gestational diabetes diabetes of pregnancy 6. corticosteroid induced diabetesindustrial chromium completely different form than that found in foods is toxic. people with diabetes who take chromium should be under medical supervision since their insulin dosage may need to be reduced as blood sugar drops. many studies detailing chromium 's benefits have used chromium picolinate easily absorbed form. chromium nicotinate and amino acid forms of chromium are less easily absorbed than chromium picolinate but can supply adequate amounts of mineral. least absorbable form is chromium chloride which is found in some multivitamin mineral supplements.when sufficient levels of chromium are present much lower amounts of insulin are required. diabetes has been shown to develop as consequence of chromium deficiency in experimental animals and in humans sustained by prolonged total parenteral nutrition. chromium deficiency is relatively common in patients with type ii diabetes and may impair function of gtf causing uptake of glucose into cells to become less efficient. impaired chromium metabolism may also play role in diabetes of pregnancy. high insulin levels also seem to increase chromium excretion.the results of several studies suggest that chromium may play role in controlling diabetes and heart disease. for example diabetes. in one study 180 people with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive 100 mcg elemental chromium 500 mcg elemental chromium or placebo. four months later those taking either dose of chromium scored significantly lower on their fasting and two hour insulin level tests indicating improvement in their disease. those taking higher amount of chromium were also found to have lower total cholesterol levels.very small amounts of organic chromium are found in blood. that small amount is extremely important in aiding insulin in glucose metabolism. chromium is active factor in substance gtf glucose tolerance factor. it makes insulin more effective. in fact without chromium insulin ca n't do its job. it can help prevent diabetes or hypoglycemia or help those with diabetes and hypoglycemia get by with less insulin. as one gets older less chromium is retained in body. also fetus may rob chromium stores of pregnant women.a deficiency of coq10 has been linked to diabetes. chromium trace mineral depleted by diabetic medication excess iron processed foods refined carbohydrates and sugar. chromium is necessary for maintaining stable blood sugar levels through proper insulin utilization. chromium assists in treatment of diabetes and hypoglycemia. deficiency can produce glucose intolerance especially in diabetics. deficiency symptoms parallel those of diabetes. diabetes and coronary heart disease have been linked to low chromium concentrations in human tissue.symptoms of chromium deficiency increased glucose insulin total cholesterol and triglycerides resemble those of prediabetes. this certainly does n't mean that chromium alone will reverse prediabetes however many studies have shown that either chromium polynicotinate or chromium picolinate supplements do in fact improve insulin function and can lead to improved glucose tolerance. based on research most effective dose of chromium appears to be 1.000 mcg or 500 mcg twice daily with meals.while improvements are not dramatic it makes sense to include chromium for improved heart health. anyone with diabetes or hypoglycemia should definitely be supplementing with chromium. fact that chromium makes cells more sensitive to insulin has been borne out by studies done with people who had type 2 diabetes. often those who have type 2 diabetes have chromium deficiency which appears to make them more susceptible to condition.glycation is responsible for many of complications of diabetes process that chromium inhibits. to assess effects of chromium on glycosylated hemoglobin levels 180 type ii diabetes patients were divided into three groups and supplemented daily with 200 mcg of chromium 1000 mcg of chromium or placebo baker 1996. after 4 months there was improvement in both chromium treated groups. glycosylated hemoglobin measurement of average blood glucose over 2- to 3-month period was on average 6.6 in high dose group 7.5 in low dose group and 8.it occurs naturally in three different forms with one particular form chromium iii making up majority of dietary chromium. average adult body contains between 0.4 and 6 mg of chromium and older people usually have lower levels. there is wide geographical variation in chromium levels and population studies suggest that incidence of diabetes and heart disease is lower in areas where chromium intakes are relatively high. chromium is essential for normal sugar metabolism.because chromium appears to enhance action of insulin and chromium deficiency results in impaired glucose tolerance chromium insufficiency has been hypothesized to be contributing factor to development of type-2 diabetes. individuals with type-2 diabetes have been found to have higher rates of urinary chromium loss than healthy individuals especially those with diabetes of more than two years duration.in double blind studies just addition of chromium supplementation with no other dietary changes altered body fat composition to increase non fat body mass. one factor affecting chromium stores in body is amount of sugar that individual consumes. once chromium has acted as cofactor in insulin response it is excreted in urine. with high sugar diet of today turnover rate of chromium is quite high. patients with highest risk for developing frank diabetes need chromium most. highest tissue stores of chromium occur in newborns.women with gestational diabetes whose diets were supplemented with 4 mcg of chromium per kilogram of body weight daily as chromium picolinate for eight weeks had decreased fasting blood glucose and insulin levels compared with those who took placebo. dosage niacin bound chromium is more bioavailable than chromium picolinate. recent study at university of california found that chromium polynicotinate was absorbed and retained up to 311 percent better than chromium picolinate and 672 percent better than chromium chloride.for example in diabetes because of all refined foods we eat we have created deficiency of chromium because chromium is pulled out of our own tissues to help metabolize refined foods which no longer have chromium needed to metabolize them. long term result is deficiency in chromium. so when we are taking in lots of refined carbohydrates and need chromium to help metabolize sugar and to make insulin work correctly we become chromium deficient.some research also suggests that chromium polynicotinate is better absorbed than other forms. term polynicotinate indicates that chromium is bound to vitamin b3 sometimes called nicotinic acid. meanwhile research has shown that chromium picolinate helps to prevent weight gain associated with use of diabetic drug glipizide glucotrol. other forms of chromium such as chromium glycinate chelate may work as well. regardless of specific form research on chromium and diabetes points to greater efficacy of higher dosages so we recommend trying 500 mcg twice daily.reversing chromium deficiency by supplementing diet with chromium has also been demonstrated to lower body weight while increasing lean body mass. all of effects of chromium appear to be due to increased insulin sensitivity. chromium deficiency may be underlying contributing factor to large number of americans suffering from diabetes hypoglycemia and obesity. there is evidence that marginal chromium deficiency is common in united states. although no rda has been established for chromium at least 200 mcg day appears necessary for optimal sugar regulation.recent studies suggest that chromium can prevent type ii diabetes or insulin resistance. chromium functions by increasing activity of insulin thus reducing amount of insulin required to control blood sugar levels. in one study richard anderson ph.d. of u.s.d.a. human nutrition research center working with chinese researchers at beijing hospital tested effect of chromium on adult patients in early stages of type ii diabetes.based on observations that rats which were fed chromium free diet showed symptoms of diabetes mellitus type ii herbal drugs with antidiabetic action were tested for their chromium content. bilberry leaves were shown to contain particularly high chromium level of 9.0 ppm. chromium is component of so called glucose tolerance factor which is suitable for treating induced diabetes mellitus type ii in animal experiments. further research is required to determine whether chromium content of dried leaf is responsible for antidiabetic action.a few trials have reported no beneficial effects from chromium supplementation. all of these trials used 200 mcg or less of supplemental chromium which is often not adequate for people with diabetes especially if it is in form that is poorly absorbed. typical amount of chromium used in research trials is 200 mcg per day although as much as 1.000 mcg per day has been used. many doctors recommend up to 1.000 mcg per day for people with diabetes. supplementation with chromium or brewer 's yeast could potentially enhance effects of drugs for diabetes.our refined oils contain no chromium. and even raw sugar contains 83 percent more chromium than refined white product. not only do these foods not supply chromium they contribute to loss of chromium supply you were born with because they use up some of your chromium stores in their metabolism. and our refined diet not only robs us of our chromium it literally robs us of our health witness tragic rise in heart disease and blood sugar abnormalities diabetes and hypoglycemia in our country since world war ii.if you want to try chromium supplements discuss it with your doctor. this is especially important if you have diabetes since chromium may affect your blood sugar level. also many people make mistake of taking chromium at same time that they take vitamin c. vitamin c interferes with uptake of chromium. taking more than 1.200 milligrams of vitamin c daily can cause diarrhea in some people.about 90 percent of population do not get enough chromium from their food. food sources of chromium include broccoli brewer 's yeast and shellfish. to make matters worse high sugar diet typical of many americans can increase excretion of chromium leaving less

2050.,my top secrets for preventing and reversing diabetes naturalnews first it was fast food nation. now it 's diabetic nation. that 's because fast food leads to diabetes and america is now drowning in both. new report by cdc says that by 2050 nearly one third of american adults will be diabetic.it 's windfall of profits for drug companies diabetic supply companies and sick care industry in general. perhaps that 's why no one is taking any real action to halt anticipated explosion in diabetes. more people who get sick after all more money will be spent on medical treatment. it 's good for economy they say!)but solutions to diabetes exist right now. i 've personally interviewedat dr gabriel cousens'near tucson arizona www.treeoflife.nu. my own book entitledhas helped thousands of people prevent and even reverse diabetes in under month. http://www.truthpublishing.com/haltdiabetes ... as naturalnews readers know i used to be borderline diabetic myself and i suffered from hypoglycemia and borderline obesity at same time. but i was able toby doing essentially two things 1 ignoring all doctors and conventional medicinal information and 2 teaching myself principles of nutrition through lots of reading).today about decade later i remain fit healthy and athletic. at age 41 i lift weights swim bicycle and exercise on regular basis while carefully choosing foods that willhere are my top five secrets for preventing and even reversing diabetes ... secret 1. this means giving up all foods made with hfcs especially soda or other refined sugars. if you find this step difficult wean yourself off these foods day by day. it took me six months to finally end my sugar addiction for good. sodas and hfcs have caused 130.000 cases of diabetes by way https://www.naturalnews.com/028340_diabetes_s ... .secret 2. i consume at least two daily superfood smoothies made with spirulina stabilized rice bran and high density superfood powders such as www.bokusuperfood.com and www.livingfuel.com. i blend them with frozen organic fruit coconut oil and almond milk. on top of that i take dailyand various chinese medicine herbs from www.dragonherbs.com and other high quality nutritional suppliers.secret 3. i exercise over 12 hours week but that 's more than you really need to prevent diabetes. even just walking 30 minutes day can have huge impact on preventing diabetes. key is to make it aactivity.secret 4. more than 70 of white americans are vitamin d deficient. that number rises to 97 among african americans https://www.naturalnews.com/026657_vitamin_d .... latinos and asians are at around 80 deficiency. vitamin d deficiency promotes diabetes and cancer heart disease kidney disease immune suppression and so on).so if you really want to prevent diabetes boost your vitamin d levels with either daily sunshine or quality vitamin d3 supplements. vitamin d deficiency explains why diabetes is so rampant among african americans by way. did you notice that doctors do n't explain any of this to african american patients. it 's dirty littlesecret of both diabetes and cancer industries ... secret 5. avoid eating refined anything. that includes white breads.(which strongly promotes diabetes and dairy products. switch from cow 's milk to(blue diamond brand is good but i suggest you avoid silk brand. reduce or eliminate cheese from your diet. if you eat meat eat only fresh unprocessed meat because it contains chemical that destroys pancreas function. this means no pepperoni pizza no ham and potato soup no deli meat sandwiches and so on.to extent that you can do these five things yourself. diabetes is not difficult disease to prevent or reverse because it 's not really affliction that strikes you randomly. it is merely biological effect of following certain lifestyle bad foods no exercise that can be reversed in virtually anyone sometimes in just few days.i've even interviewed awho got completely off insulin by following raw foods diet with daily vegetable juicing. yes type one. read about my interview with dr cousens here https://www.naturalnews.com/028341_diabetes_l ... this

tendency to skip breakfast. others do it because they are in attempt to cut down net calorie intake too busy during morning rush or just do nt have appetite. although most americans begin their day with breakfast one out of 10 which is approximately 10 percents of us population do nt studies show. they did nt eat or drinking anything before 11 a.m. for some reasons including they were not hungry thirsty or did nt feel like eating or drinking. other reasons they skipped breakfast are that they did nt have time and were too busy. despite some reports on other hand vast majority of studies have shown that eating breakfast is important for good health. rest of this article discusses major side effects of skipping breakfast. study from harvard university found that men who skipped breakfast had 27 percent greater risk of heart attack or death from coronary than those who did eat morning meal. although they did nt pinpoint causal relationship authors believe that remaining in fasting state for longer can cause metabolic changes which may eventually induce variety of chronic and degenerative diseases including heart disease. skipping breakfast may lead to one or more risk factors including obesity high blood pressure high cholesterol and diabetes which in turn lead to heart attack over time. cortisol is stress hormone. its levels are highest around 7 a.m. every morning. taking breakfast will bring its levels down. skipping breakfast would make cortisol levels remain elevated until you eat meal. at normal condition your calcium levels in blood are higher than in cells. chronically elevated cortisol levels on other hand causes more calcium enter cells that lead to higher calcium levels in cells than that of blood. this in turn leads to hypertension. besides hypertension skipping breakfast can make you anxious and jittery. study has found skipping breakfast was associated with diabetes type 2. in case of diabetes chronically elevated cortisol levels do two things increasing insulin secretion and releasing glycogen from its storage to be broken down into sugar. drawback of chronically elevated insulin levels is that it can lead to insulin resistant consequently results in diabetes. so skipping breakfast every day for many years is actually making your body to be exposed to chronic long term stress. stress on other hand is associated with increased of reactive oxygen species levels especially superoxide which is associated with atherosclerosis. blocked arteries coupled with hypertension both of which started by skipping breakfast as discussed in article can lead to heart attack. nitric oxide is said to function as antioxidant to superoxide however chronic stress causes nitric oxide production by endothelial cells to decrease. as discussed above there seems to be link between skipping breakfast and elevated cortisol levels which can cause stress to your brain and bodily functions. studies have shown link between stress which can be caused by elevated cortisol levels in response to stress and high bad cholesterol ldl. i personally believe that most articles you have read so far may have not explained possible mechanism how elevated cortisol can cause increased ldl levels. typical explanation reads like this one body releases hormone called cortisol in response to stress. high levels of cortisol from long term stress may be mechanism behind how stress can increase cholesterol. i have my own way of explaining it which some of you might have already heard before. increased levels of superoxide which causes deleterious effect on many types of molecules of cell membrane in turn leads to membrane structure instability. cholesterol is only molecule used by cell membrane to strengthen its structure during normal conditions and when structure is impaired after being attacked by free radicals such as superoxide oxidative stress. so during chronic stress more superoxide is produced by cells that can cause more and more cell membranes become impaired. as most of you have heard before that elevated cortisol cause liver to produce and release ldl bad cholesterol. ldl turns into oxycholesterol when it is oxidized by superoxide right after being produced in liver or while on way to cells to be incorporated in cell membrane to strengthen it. other impacts of skipping breakfast include you may get stupid get hungry and irritable your energy dip and your metabolism may slow down. you may also have more cravings later and gain weight. hypoglycemia headache migraine nausea depression sleepiness unable to focus gastritis and inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis may also likely ensue.,skipping breakfast consequences elevated cortisol heart disease hypertension diabetes obesity anxiety

cancer to diabetes.,in recent years term plant medicine has come to be associated with psychedelics like mushrooms and ayahuasca which are increasingly documented to provide mental and emotional relief to users. but according to recent analysis from kew gardens in united kingdom there are over 28.000 other plants currently being used as medicine throughout world. second annual report from britains royal botanic gardens at kew located in london is result of research and analysis of 128 scientists from 12 countries around across globe. according to their findings there are 28.187 plants currently recorded as being of medicinal use. report pdf explains in many regions of world people still rely on traditional plant based medicines for their primary healthcare. this is especially true for many rural communities in africa parts of asia and central and south america where plants and knowledge of their traditional use are accessible and affordable. in other countries many of these traditional plant based medicines are being integrated through regulations into mainstream health systems. though plant medicines are making their way into mainstream researchers note that currently just 16 4.478 of species used in plant based medicines are cited in medicinal regulatory publication. even so they note data on drugs approved by fda and similar agencies since 1981 1.130 new therapeutic agents have been approved for use as pharmaceutical drugs of which 593 are based on compounds from natural sources. thirty eight are derived from medicinal plants. fifteen of 56 natural drugs registered for treatment of cancer since 1980 are derived from medicinal plants with long history of traditional use. they note for example that anti cancerous drugs vincristine and vinblastine are derived from madagascar periwinkle catharanthus roseus in apocynaceae family. for example drugs based on paclitaxel have been isolated from yew tree taxus spp. camptothecin from happy tree camptotheca acuminata and podophyllotoxin from may apple podophyllum hexandrum and p. peltatum. further researchers have discovered over 1.000 species of beneficial plants since their survey last year. as yahoo news summarized new plants discovered over past year include nine species of climbing vine used in treatment of parkinsons disease. report said two plants artemisinin and quinine are among most important weapons against malaria which killed over 400.000 people in 2015 yahoo summarized. according to monique simmonds deputy director of science at kew report is highlighting huge potential that there is for plants in areas like diabetes and malaria yahoo reported. one study documents 656 flowering plant species used traditionally for diabetes representing 437 genera and 111 families report explains. it also points out that of only five drugs developed specifically for symptomatic treatment of alzheimers disease two are derived from plants. some particularly powerful species of plants include fabaceae pea and bean lamiaceae mint euphorbiaceae spurge apocynaceae dogbane malvaceae mallow apiaceae parsley or carrot and ranunculaceae buttercup. their key classes of compounds are alkaloids fabaceae terpenes lamiaceae diterpenoids euphorbiaceae cardiac glycosides apocynaceae organic acids malvaceae coumarins apiaceae and alkaloids ranunculaceae. another highly useful plant documented in report is moraceae which is used in treatment of diabetes. though their report offers great promise they highlight some pitfalls. stressing that correct labeling of plant medicines is vital they explain product labeling is frequently misleading with trade name ginseng for example referring to 15 different species of plant each with its own particular chemistry and therapeutic properties[10. substitution by belgian clinic of one chinese medicinal herb fang ji with another sharing same name led to over 100 patients requiring kidney dialysis for remainder of their lives. they also point out threat to plants themselves. increasing demand for herbal medicines particularly for species covered by pharmacopoeias threatens wild populations of many of these plants they note adding that focus of world trade on relatively few species of medicinal plants leads to sustainability and conservation issues which ultimately lead to other plants being substituted with potential risks to human health. they advocate more precise scientific labeling of plants and more clarity on which plants have or have not been studied in drug discovery programmes. such approaches they contend will be hugely important in improving our ability to realise current and future medicinal benefits from plants. as pharmaceutical drugs continue to wreak hazardous consequences healing power of natural plants appears to hold great promise for humans seeking treatment without chemical side effects of current popular medicines.,in recent years term plant medicine has come to be associated with psychedelics like mushrooms and ayahuasca which are increasingly documented to provide mental and emotional relief to users.but according to recent analysis from kew gardens in united

generation whole food used for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes with no side effects some scientists suggested. type 2 diabetes is medical condition characterized by insufficient insulin entering bloodstream to regulate glucose due to either cell in pancreas dying off or receptor sites clogged up by fat and cholesterol. researchers do not know what causes pancreas dying off or receptor sites clogged up. however they do know obesity or overweight gender ethnicity age family history gestation diabetes are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. some researchers also suggested that people with certain medical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome. and high blood pressure is more prone to onset of disease. most common symptoms of type 2 diabetes are increased thirst that wo nt stop with water intake increased hunger especially after eating dry mouth frequent urination and unintentional weight loss. if you experience some of symptoms above please make you check with your doctor to rule out possibility of diabetes. according to statistics diabetes is one most common disease in us. approximately 10 or 29.1 million people in united states have diabetes accompanied by 8.1 million that are undiagnosed and unaware of their condition. about 1.4 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed in united states every year. more than one in every 10 adults who are 20 years or older has diabetes. dr. rita r. kalyani in study to examine increase with age and risk of type 2 diabetes wrote unprecedented aging of worlds population is major contributor to diabetes epidemic and older adults represent one of fastest growing segments of diabetes population. almost one third of u.s. adults over age of 65 years have diabetes. approximately half of those are undiagnosed and additional one third of older adults have prediabetes and management of older adults with diabetes is clearly more complicated given observation that they commonly have multiple coexisting medical conditions that can impact clinical management. compared to general population risk of type 2 diabetes results clearly stated risk of type diabetes in elderly is 3 fold higher and

allocated randomly into ginger group consumed 1600 mg ginger and control group consumed 1600 mg wheat flour daily for 12 weeks. patients treated with ginger demonstrated significant effect in reducing levels of fasting plasma glucose 3 months average glucose concentration insulin resistance. furthermore blood profile of treatment group also displayed lower levels of triglyceride total cholesterol hormone associated with lipid peroxidation. compared to placebo group. there were no significant differences in high density lipoprotein hdl low density lipoprotein ldl and tnf inflammatory cytokine between two groups. findings firmly indicated ginger improves insulin sensitivity and some fractions of lipid profiles and reduced inflammation in type 2 diabetic patients. additionally with aim to reaffirm effects of ginger against development of type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications researchers investigated effect of ginger supplementation on glycemic indices in iranian patients with type 2 diabetes. double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial included 20 60 -year old patients with type 2 diabetes who did not receive insulin. participants in intervention and control groups were received 3 g of powdered ginger or placebo lactose in capsules daily for 3 months. at end of 3 months researchers showed that all parameters associated diabetes were reduced substantially in treatment group compared to control. more precisely differences between ginger and placebo groups were statistically significant as follows serum glucose -19.41 18.83 vs. 1.63 4.28 mg dl p 0.001

what. pokmon go now touted as solution for tackling obesity and type 2 diabetes alternative before it 's news.,we are now living in era where almost every piece of news either sinks you deeper into matrix of lies and deceit or it has opposite effect it will wake you up even more to surreal levels of lies and deceit were all being bombarded with every day now. this next broad and ridiculous medical psyop claim now being made by dr tom yates supposed specialist diabetes researcher at university of leicester in uk is no exception. in fact this latest claim stretches boundaries of good science and what is supposed to be evidence based medicine to new levels of propaganda lies and deceit. in effort to sell idea that everyone should download pokmon go new cia created virtual reality video game that has zombies chasing fake virtual reality characters all around world while providing ruling elite with detailed information on locations they would otherwise not be able to reach dr yates resorts to most broad and meaningless claims that no one should ever take serious. his claims are so broad unscientific and meaningless that they fall in area of correlation at best. before i expose this latest medical psyop propaganda claim lets consider what correlation is and how it differs from causation as in cause and effect which is what medicine and science is supposed to be about. any 2 things can correlate without any direct meaningful causation. following examples are examples of correlations that no one in their right mind would pay attention to yet they do in fact correlate. all following sample statements are true but none of them have any scientific or statistically meaningful significance. a- there is correlation between daylight and car crashes. b- there is correlation between breathing and dying. c- there is correlation between eating ice cream and drowning in ocean. d- there is correlation between having bank account and dying in bank robbery. e- there is correlation between getting hair cut and becoming president of united states. you get picture. from statistical standpoint correlation is defined as so why am i making such big deal about establishing what correlation is all about. because correlation is as scientific as taking wild guess about something. it has zero scientific value and anyone using correlation to make scientific or medical claim is lying to you. causation on other hand implies that you have proven your scientific hypothesis and shown direct cause and effect between two items. nothing you are about to read demonstrates this. in this latest psyop medical claim dr yates states that since pokmon go forces you to walk around and walking is considered exercise and since exercising is said to decrease chances of type 2 diabetes then pokmon go can now be viewed as solution for tackling rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes. this is about as unscientific and disingenuous medical claim as it gets. lets put it this way using dr yates criteria of what it takes to tackle type 2 diabetes then robbing banks and running from police is great way to tackle type 2 diabetes or obesity as well. in fact if you get shot and killed or whether you end up in jail where you ll have access to free exercise and weight rooms you should probably find in this path way of tackling type 2 diabetes or obesity so lets all go rob banks and run from police right. this is precisely logic being floated by this latest mainstream media report specialist diabetes researcher sees pokmon go virtual character hunting game with millions of players worldwide as excellent means of tackling rising levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes. pokmon go has now piqued interest of medical world. smartphone based character hunting craze that s sweeping world has caught attention of researcher at university of leicester uk specializing in international diabetes research. in fact dr tom yates sees application as potential means of tackling sedentary lifestyles and obesity which can lead to type 2 diabetes. one of main recommendations in prevention and treatment of diabetes is regular physical exercise totaling at least two and half hours per week. previous study from university of leicester published in journal diabetes care concluded that integrating five minute breaks every half hour into inactive lifestyles during prolonged periods of sitting significantly reduced blood sugar and insulin levels. breaks were used to introduce five minutes of walking or other forms of movement. pokmon go is interesting solution since players can cover several kilometers without even realizing. according to dr tom yates if there is something out there which is getting people off sofa and pounding streets then this game could be innovative solution for rising obesity levels. walking is hugely underrated yet it is mans best and cheapest form of exercise. its easy and accessible way to get active and help maintain healthy body. experts suggest this fun and non violent game can be good form of exercise and can be played by whole family. however users should take care not to let their pokmon hunt lead to dangerous behavior avoiding playing while driving or crossing roads for example and steering clear of venturing into dark isolated areas. risk factors for diabetes include genetic predisposition and family history but above all obesity lack of physical exercise and sedentary lifestyles. no one should be fooled by this medical psyop claim being told to us by same controllers that were telling us in 2014 that flu shot which is entirely unnecessary and even proven dangerous is somehow possible solution to decreased heart disease. this is same medical psyop propaganda machine that last year 2015 put out claims that global warming is linked to kidney disease story i exposed back then. as you can see claiming that pokmon go is fun and non violent way to tackle obesity and type 2 diabetes is just another piece of propaganda engineered by cia with help of their mainstream media in effort to popularize this intelligence tool in hopes that everyone jumps on board and downloads game so they can get complete control of human domain exactly as outlined in jade helm slogan rules and supporting documents revealed by it insider and researcher dj in 2015 indicating they want nothing less than to master human domain. fact is that as human beings we have all natural foods and knowledge available to us to live happy healthy life without electronics without gmo foods without mandatory big pharm vaccines and without psyop virtual reality video games like pokmon go. fact that we are obligated to expose this horrific psyop lie is testament to times in which we live. if you are not completely convinced ruling elite are deliberately rolling out these psyops then please do your own research. controllers have clearly stated their plan to control every aspect of humanity and pokmon go psyop application is one of ways they intend to do it.,we are now living in era where almost every piece of news either sinks you deeper into matrix of lies and deceit or it ....

medicine holds potential as natural remedy for diabetes. ,natural news researchers from university of malaya in malaysia have found potential treatment for type 2 diabetes in java brucea brucea javanica plant commonly found in malay peninsula. in study which was published in bmc complementary and alternative medicine team evaluated plants anti diabetic antioxidant and anti inflammatory actions using type 2 diabetes rat models. diabetes of course is nothing short of worldwide epidemic. in u.s. alone over 30 million people are diagnosed with condition with 95 percent of cases being type 2 diabetes. in particular type 2 diabetes occurs when body can not properly use insulin state referred to as insulin resistance leading to increase in blood glucose over time. if condition is left untreated this can lead to severe complications such as cardiovascular disease kidney failure and even loss of vision. in study researchers addressed need to find effective treatments to combat condition which is expected to affect at least 592 million people worldwide by 2035. potential therapeutic agents that improve efficiency in controlling t2d type 2 diabetes and retard its related complications are urgently needed they wrote in their report. indeed different anti diabetes medications exist however studies have shown that long term dependency on these can result in harmful side effects. in addition it can also have adverse economic impact with most people failing to get treatment they need because of its sheer price. in separate study in journal of traditional and complementary medicine researchers have pointed out two important things plant based treatments have been around since ancient times and continue even today and most commercially produced drugs are largely derived from plants. team focused on treatments that are not only effective but are cost effective and readily available. this led them to study java brucea which have been proven in earlier studies to reduce blood sugar in non diabetic mice. for this study they sought to determine its effect in rats that have been treated with nicotinamide na and streptozotocin stz to induce diabetes. in particular stz is known to damage pancreatic b cells which produce insulin while na is used to partially protect some cells from damage. to create extract java brucea seeds were oven dried and ground into powder then extracted with 95 percent ethanol solvent. resulting hydroethanolic extract was then fractionated with n hexane chloroform and ethyl acetate. researchers collected some fractions to undergo different assays to determine its physicochemical properties anti diabetes and antioxidant activities and its ability to inhibit. -glucosidase and glycogen phosphorylase. two enzymes in particular absorb carbohydrates in small intestine and convert it into glucose which can be detrimental to people with type 2 diabetes. researchers grouped sprague dawley rats into five groups namely groups iii and iv which were given ethyl acetate fraction of java brucea at 25 and 50 mg of fraction per kilogram of body weight in day mg kg day respectively group v which were given glibenclamide drug normally used to treat diabetes at 10 mg kg day tests ran for four weeks during which rats body weight and blood glucose were measured weekly. at end of tests rats were anesthetized and blood samples as well as organs were harvested and studied. researchers evaluated serum insulin lipid profile renal function liver glycogen and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation from rats using blood and tissue analysis. eaf ethyl acetate fraction showed antihyperglycemic and antioxidant potential and reduced levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in t2d type 2 diabetic rats researchers wrote. in particular rats that were treated with fraction exhibited glucose lowering potential by inhibiting. -glucosidase and glycogen phosphorylase. activity slowing down carbohydrate intake and improving glucose regulation in people with diabetes. eaf treated rats also exhibited weight loss which researchers explained as outcome of extracts hypolipidemic effect. extract also showed potent antioxidant activity synergistic effect of its active ingredients para hydroxybenzoic acid protocatechuic acid and gallic acid. finally anti diabetes activity of eaf was more potent than that of glibenclamide which has side effects that range from nausea low blood sugar to weight gain. findings revealed that java brucea has potential to be used to treat type 2 diabetes mainly by slowing down glucose conversion and regulating carbohydrate metabolism and hepatic glucose. these effects could be result of synergistic effect of bioactive ingredients in seeds but researchers suggest further studies to accurately identify underlying mechanisms. related type 2 diabetes diet what to eat what to avoid and how to get healthier with every meal. learn more about herbs in your area that you can

before eating your next sandwich on white bread. studies show that alloxan chemical that makes white flour look clean and beautiful destroys beta cells of pancreas. that 's right you may be devastating your pancreas and putting yourself at risk for diabetes all for sake of eating beautiful flour. is it worth it. scientists have known of alloxan diabetes connection for years in fact researchers who are studying diabetes commonly use chemical to induce disorder in lab animals. in research sense giving alloxan to animal is similar to injecting that animal with deadly virus as both alloxan and virus are being used specifically to cause illness. every day consumers ingest foods made with alloxan contaminated flour. would they just as willingly consume foods tainted with deadly virus. unless they had death wish they probably would not. unfortunately most consumers are unaware of alloxan and its potentially fatal link to diabetes because these facts are not well publicized by food industry. how does alloxan cause diabetes. according to dr. hari sharma 's freedom from disease uric acid derivative initiates free radical damage to dna in beta cells of pancreas causing cells to malfunction and die. when these beta cells fail to operate normally they no longer produce enough insulin or in other words they cause one variety of adult onset type 2 diabetes. alloxan 's harmful effects on pancreas are so severe that textbook of natural medicine calls chemical potent beta cell toxin. however even though toxic effect of alloxan is common scientific knowledge in research community fda still allows companies to use it when processing foods we ingest. fda and white flour industry could counter argue that if alloxan were to cause diabetes higher proportion of americans would be diabetic. after all more consumers consume white flour on regular basis than are actually diabetic. this point is valid but it does not disprove alloxan diabetes connection. while alloxan is one cause of adult onset type 2 diabetes it is of course not only cause. as textbook of natural medicine states current theory suggests hereditary beta cell predisposition to injury coupled with some defect in tissue regeneration capacity may be key cause. for alloxan to cause injury to individual 's beta cells individual must have genetic susceptibility to injury. this is similar to connection between high cholesterol foods and heart disease. eating high cholesterol foods causes heart disease especially in people who have family histories of heart disease. link between alloxan and diabetes is as clear and solid as link between cholesterol and heart disease. if you 've been eating white bread for years and you have family history of diabetes all hope is not lost for you. studies show that you can reverse effects of alloxan by supplementing your diet with vitamin e. according to dr. gary null 's clinicians handbook of natural healing vitamin e effectively protected lab rats from harmful effects of administered alloxan. now you 're not lab rat but you 're mammal and vitamin e is definitely worth adding to your daily regimen of nutritional supplements especially if you have history of eating foods made with white flour and are at high risk for diabetes. even if you are already diabetic some simple changes to your diet can help treat your diabetes. first of all stop eating foods made with white flour. even though you already have diabetes vitamin e supplements can still help you as can many common foods. garlic for example does wonders for diabetes. as dr. benjamin lau states in his book garlic for health when fed garlic rabbits elevated blood sugar dropped almost as much as it did when they were given antidiabetic drug tolbutamide. researchers postulated that garlic may improve insulin effect. if you ca n't handle taste of natural garlic you can take it in widely available supplements. aloe vera is traditional diabetic remedy in arabian peninsula and its therapeutic characteristics are now gaining worldwide acceptance in treatment of diabetes. according to both human and animal research studies aloe vera lowers blood glucose levels by unknown mechanism. according to clinicians handbook of natural healing this natural hypoglycemic effect extended over period of 24 hours. adding onions to your diet along with garlic can also significantly reduce your blood sugar level. additionally as dr. michael t. murray writes in healing power of herbs studies show that ginseng controls glucose in both diabetic humans and diabetic laboratory animals. it all comes down to asking if putting yourself at risk for diabetic coma blindness limb amputation and death is worth eating white bread. if you 're willing to risk your quality of life and your life itself then go ahead and eat all foods made with white flour you want. however if you want to stop poisoning yourself with alloxan known toxic chemical then make few simple dietary changes. eat groceries made with whole grain wheat flour not processed white flour. animal experiments have shown that animals which have their beta cells destroyed by alloxan are able to regenerate beta cells after few months when taking gs herb grown in india. beta cell is cell that produces insulin. diabetics needing insulin treatment type 1 have been able to decrease their insulin after gs therapy. in mid-1980s however when herbal remedies again were popular pata de vaca 's continued use as natural insulin substitute was reiterated in two brazilian studies. both studies reported in vivo hypoglycemic actions in various animal and human models. chilean research in 1999 reported actions of pata de vaca in diabetic rats. their study determined that pata de vaca was found to elicit remarkable hypoglycemic effects and brought about decrease of glycemia in alloxan diabetic rats by 39. in 2002 two in vivo studies on blood sugar lowering effects of pata de vaca were conducted by two separate research groups in brazil. first study reported significant blood glucose lowering effect in normal and diabetic rats. healing power of rainforest herbs by leslie taylor page 382 when beta cells in pancreas fail to secrete enough insulin body loses its ability to metabolize carbohydrates and to reduce glucose levels in bloodstream. researchers believe that some people have weak free radical defenses in these beta cells and that free radical damage to dna in beta cells resulting in dysfunction or cell death helps cause maturity onset diabetes. it is known for example that many chemicalsincluding alloxan paraquat and certain chemotherapeutic agentscan stimulate excessive production of oxy radicals in nuclei of beta cells. freedom from disease by hari sharma md page 94 ... nearly two decades later researchers at rnt medical college in india induced diabetes in rabbits with intravenous injections of alloxan. when fed garlic rabbits elevated blood sugar dropped almost as much as it did when they were given antidiabetic drug tolbutamide. researchers postulated that garlic may improve insulin effect by either increasing pancreatic secretion of insulin or by releasing bound insulin. garlic for health by benjamin lau md phd page 22 commercial yeasted breads even whole grain varieties often have other problems. they typically contain flour bleach which forms alloxan compound known to cause diabetes in animals by destroying beta cells of pancreas clinical nutrition newsletter dec. 1982. healing with whole foods by paul pitchford page 452 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is generally recognized to be due to insulin deficiency.1 although exact cause is unknown current theory suggests hereditary beta cell predisposition to injury coupled with some defect in tissue regeneration capacity. causes of injury are most likely hydroxyl and other free radicals viral infection and autoimmune reactions. alloxan uric acid derivative used to induce experimental diabetes in animals is potent beta cell toxin causing destruction via hydroxyl radical formation. textbook of natural medicine volumes 1 2 by joseph e pizzorno and michael t murray page 1197 in this study mice received intraperitoneally melatonin in doses ranging from 100 to 450 mg kg. results showed that such treatment proved plasma glucose increase due to alloxan induced pancreatic toxicity. clinicians handbook of natural healing by gary null phd page 88 bleached white flour. not only have bran and germ been stripped away but bleached flour also contains substance from flour bleach alloxan which causes diabetes in animals. unbleached white flour should also be avoided since it is stripped of essential nutrients. enzyme cure by lita lee with lisa turner burton goldberg

xanthurenic acid binds insulin impeding it 's action vitamin b6 lowers xanthurenic acid levels to normal in two 1970s research studies 86 and 100 of women with gestational diabetes normalized their blood sugar in two weeks by taking vitamin b6 gestational diabetes increases autism risk for unborn child vitamin b6 eliminates that extra risk(article by jonathan v. wright md republished from tahomaclinic.com no not kidding. if you 're pregnant woman who never had any sort of diabetes before you became pregnant and developed high blood sugar only after becoming pregnant gestational diabetes you can safely eliminate it all by yourself within two to three weeks. you might have remedy at home already. if not trip to your favorite natural food store compounding pharmacy or maybe even online order from tahoma clinic dispensary or other online source will equip you to eliminate gestational diabetes almost every time.of course if you 're man you 'll never have this problem. however your wife sister or daughter might so keep this information in mind in case it 's ever needed.one of many reasons gestational diabetes should be eliminated as rapidly as possible was discovered recently and published in journal of american medical association just last year. what is this reason. autism!here 's what researchers wrote exposure to maternal gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed by 26 weeks gestation was associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in offspring. yes that 's extra risk for child of developing autism!but even though blood and urine sugar is higher than normal in those with. to make this point clear to everyone gestational diabetes should be renamed to clearly identify its cause excess serum xanthurenic acid. when this renaming occurs even conventional medicine might quit treating gestational diabetes with diabetic diet and insulin and might instead actuallyhere 's what webmd says is cause of gestational diabetes during pregnancy placenta ... releases hormones that help your baby grow. some of these make it harder for your body to make or use insulin. this is called insulin resistance .... to keep your blood sugar levels steady your pancreas has to make ... as much as three times more insulin than usual. if it ca n't make enough extra insulin your blood sugar will rise and you 'll get gestational diabetes.treatment for gestational diabetes always includes. it may also include daily blood glucose testing and insulin injections.let 's send note to webmd and ada read medical research. what actually causes gestational diabetes was well researched between 1940s and 1975 when report summarized earlier research and then explained that gestational diabetes is caused by excessive amounts of xanthurenic acid usually present in blood in very low levels. all this xanthurenicacid combines with insulin molecules and blocks its activity. xanthurenic acid insulin complex ca n't activate insulin receptors nearly as well as insulin alone does and blood sugar rises.back to causes of diabetes mellitus type 2 and type 1. in type 2 cause is overproduction of insulin in response to carbohydrates and dairy but explanation for that at another time. as march issue of green medicine explains overproduced chronically high insulin causes insulin resistance which in turn leads to even more insulin secretion to overcome that resistance which leads to even more insulin secretion.this back and forth upward trending interplay more insulin more resistance even more insulin even more resistance and so on goes on and on unless carbs""and dairyare significantly restricted until insulin resistance is so strong it ca n't be completely overcome no matter how much insulin there may be. blood sugar then goes too highand it 's diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. this known cause of type 2 diabetes is very different than cause of diabetes mellitus xanthurenica!the cause of type 1 diabetes is much simpler. for variety of reasons insulin producing cells islet cells become weak and die. when that happens insulin levels go lower and lower until there 's very little insulin or even noneand that 's type 1 diabetes. again very different cause from diabetes mellitus xanthurenica.but does n't everyone 's body chemistry make xanthurenic acid. it 's metabolite of tryptophan. indeed 100 of us have this body chemistry. so why do n't we all have gestational diabetes even if we 're not pregnant or even women. reason is that levels of xanthurenic acid are relatively low in most of us unless we 're deficient in certain b vitamin to be named later so not very much of xanthurenicacid insulin complex is formed.what 's different during pregnancy. among other things it 's combination of genetic causes together with those really high estrogen levels that women 's bodies make when pregnantway way more than when not pregnant. but why does all that extra estrogen cause only minority of women 's bodies to make lots more xanthurenic acid and develop gestational diabetes when most women 's bodies do n't do that?that 's genetic part women who develop gestational diabetes have weakness in enzymes that metabolize tryptophan into serotonin and melatonin but no weakness in enzymes that metabolize tryptophan into xanthurenic acid. without pregnancy levels of estrogen putting pressure on these weak enzymes they can perform as they do in most womenmetabolizing much less of their tryptophan into xanthurenic acid and much more of itinto many other molecules we 've all heard about including serotonin and melatonin.with high levels of estrogen during pregnancy weak enzymes falter and metabolize much more tryptophan than usual into xanthurenic acid and much less into melatonin serotonin and related molecules. if there 's much more xanthurenic acid there 's much more insulin xanthurenic acid complex formed and greater impairment of insulin activity. with enough insulin impaired diabetes""gestational""is result.but woman ca n't stop being pregnant for many months anyway and she definitely ca n't change her genetics so she ca n't really rid herself of gestational diabetes returning to normal blood sugar levels while reducing her baby 's risk of autism too within two to three weeks. or can she?yes she can. to understand how here is refresher onwhat many of us learnedor should have learnedin high school and college chemistry about how enzymes change one molecule into another. key is that enzymes never work alone. they 're always aided byco factors that are almost always essential necessary to life vitamins and minerals. without those co factors enzymes ca n't function and ultimately we die. that 's why they 're defined as essential nutrients!""weak enzyme function can frequently be strengthened by adding in more co factors. key co factor for enzymes that metabolize tryptophan into serotonin and melatonin is vitamin b6. here are theresults that women with gestational diabetes achieved by taking extra vitamin b6 to strengthen their genetically weak enzymes. in 1975 fourteen pregnant women were diagnosed with gestational diabetes by standard glucose tolerance test. all women took 100 milligrams of vitamin b6 as pyridoxine daily for two weeks. repeat testing found that twelve of fourteen 86 no longer had problem!in 1977 different researchers reported almost identical results in same length of time for thirteen women.all took 100 milligrams daily of vitamin b6 as pyridoxine. glucose tolerance tests were done before and after. all fourteen women 100 had statistically significant improvements in their glucose tolerance tests. researchers wrote low vitamin b6 levels appear to alter metabolic pathways which result in lowering of biologic activity of endogenous insulin. in english vitamin b6 strengthened specific weak enzymes so that less xanthurenic acid was available to be complexed with insulin blocking its activity. better blood sugar control was regained.the 1975 and 1977 research was actually done more than two decades after several groups of researchers...had confirmed in early 1950s that vitamin b6 returned levels of xanthurenic acid to normal. for technically inclined all 1950s research and much more was reviewed in 1960 publication titled effect of vitamin supplementation on urinary excretion of tryptophan metabolites by pregnant women""which confirmed that pyridoxine lowered xanthurenic acid!and one last fact textbooks of laboratory medicine in 1940s told us that higher than usual xanthurenicacid in urine is diagnostic for vitamin b6 deficiency. it 's 2016 yet despite all this forty- to seventy year old basic science and clinical research demonstrating cause and cure of gestational diabetes it 's still not being applied!but youyes you if you want to prevent gestational diabetes or cure yourself of itcan apply this extensive science. you can safely prevent or cure gestational diabetes yourself and at same time reduce your child 's risk of autism!don't use pyridoxine form of vitamin b6. that 's actually inactive form of vitamin b6 which actually does not activate receptors for this vitamin. mostbut not allhumans can activate pyridoxine but we have no way without testing to know if you are in pyridoxine activating group or not. it 's quite possible that 14 whose gestational diabetes did n't disappear in 1975 research summarized above were poor activators of pyridoxine.)to make sure pyridoxine actually does its job it 's best to use active form pyridoxal-5-phosphate usually shortened

""chris askew chief executive of diabetes uk minces no words when he says diabetes is killer. it 's serious condition with serious life threatening complications. ""one of biggest issues with diabetes is that most people do not take it seriously enough. as dr. john buse professor of medicine at university of north carolina medical school said it 's disease where even when people are diagnosed they often think oh diabetes they check your sugar. it 's not such bid deal. even some medical professionals do not take it seriously.in surveys diabetes is generally ranked as being about half as serious as conditions like cancer and heart disease but that really could n't be further from truth. diabetes is life threatening disease. there is huge disconnect between people 's perception of diabetes and reality of disease. there are many complications associated with this condition. heart disease kidney damage nerve damage foot ulcers and amputations retinopathy and eye conditions are just some of health problems associated with diabetes. cognitive function and mental health can also become impaired as result of diabetes. people with diabetes are at increased risk of developing dementia as they age and they are more likely to experience memory problems. diabetes also doubles risk of depression. type 2 diabetes is disease that is generally brought about by lifestyle and eating habits.notes that type 2 diabetes crisis is result of ever expanding obesity epidemic. in attempt to cull rising prevalence of diabetes nhs england launched what they are calling diabetes prevention programme. program seeks to offer advice on healthy eating weight loss exercise regimes and other aspects of healthy lifestyle.in uk treatment of diabetes and its effects eats up about 10 percent of nhs 's yearly budget. it is not cheap illness to have and many are growing concerned over its ever increasing costs. experts fear that is just matter of time before hospitals will be forced to pick and choose which conditions they can treat. martin claridge vascular surgeon commented i am worried. nhs will have to decide what conditions it does or does not treat and that is very difficult decision to make. ""the prospects for united states do not seem to be looking any brighter. in 2012 total cost of diabetes to us reached 245 billion. adjusted averages revealed that cost of care for person with diabetes was more than double that of person without diabetes.diabetes is huge problem in western society that needs to be addressed and acknowledged not just by government but by every single person especially those at risk or already diagnosed. in 2013 data released by cdc showed that only 16 percent of diabetics managed their condition with diet exercise and lifestyle changes like weight loss. that means that 84 percent of diagnosed diabetics are relying on medication. while it is true that sometimes weight loss and dietary changes still may not be enough does it really seem plausible that overwhelming majority of people are actually doing their best to fight their condition and are still unable to manage their diabetes without drugs?the goal of mainstream medicine has not been to help people with diabetes to lead normal lives it has been to keep them alive long enough to keep renewing their prescriptions.",diabetes skyrockets 75 in just one decade ... medical system clueless about answers.

,natural news ginseng herb that s been used in many traditional systems of medicine in asia can improve abnormally high levels of glucose as well as blood cholesterol to effectively regulate or even prevent type 2 diabetes according to study by researchers from south korea. in particular researchers identified black ginseng derivative of root that had undergone further processing to be better than other forms in terms of biological activities. lot of people are familiar with health properties of ginseng panax ginseng and studies have reported that herb is beneficial in treating conditions in central nervous system boosting cognitive performance and even preventing fatigue. however confusion comes when selecting ginseng as these may come either in white or red and more recently black. red ginseng which has long been used in traditional chinese medicine is used to boost immune system and improve heart health among others. its also popular with men as natural way to treat erectile dysfunction. to create red ginseng raw ginseng is first steamed then dried. white ginseng is mostly used to relieve stress and restore bodys balance. it can also help alleviate physical and mental fatigue as well as regulate bodily systems. this is made by simply air drying raw ginseng roots. black ginseng relatively new form of processed ginseng is made by steaming and drying ginseng for total of nine times after which resulting product is blackened due to maillard reaction. earlier studies have noted that this prolonged heat treatment improves antioxidant capacity of black ginseng. biological and pharmacological activities of steam processed ginseng are greater than that of nonsteamed ginseng researchers wrote. during steaming and drying process percentage of main ingredients including saponin ginsenosides proteins and phenolics is altered because of newly produced active ingredients. in study team discovered new forms of ginsenosides active ingredient in ginseng that were more potent than either red or white ginseng. this meant that black ginseng contained more antioxidant activity which can prevent development of cancer and diabetes and improve recovery time from memory and learning damages. for study researchers evaluated anti diabetes effects of black ginseng extract gbg05-ff in mice that had type 2 diabetes. mice were placed into either control or experimental group with latter fed with 300 mg per kilogram of body weight of gbg05-ff supplement. experiment ran for four weeks with team measuring their weights every week. at end of test blood as well as liver and muscle samples were harvested for further analysis. in particular glucose expression in liver and skeletal muscles as well as fat buildup in liver were examined to determine whether gbg05-ff possessed anti diabetes activity. researchers found that ginsenosides present in black ginseng were more potent than those present in white ginseng. this meant that health benefits that black ginseng contains can better interact with body. they also discovered that mice given gbg05-ff had better regulation of insulin and glucose two key compounds in development of diabetes. it also decreased lipid accumulation and muscle damage in liver caused by type 2 diabetes. extract was also able to inhibit glucose production from ampk protein while enhancing phosphorylation effectively breaking down glucose into energy. related ginseng found highly effective for weight loss and diabetes control. findings of research suggest that black ginseng could effectively regulate abnormally high levels of glucose and cholesterol in bloodstream. this could be helpful in managing and even preventing development of diabetes and similar conditions. according to researchers this could be very useful in producing functional food in future. black ginsengs might play important role in development of promising functional foods and drugs from viewpoint of chemical composition and biological activities of black ginsengs with distinction from those of white and red ginsengs they added. for those looking to get most out of black ginseng making it into tea is best way to do it. this could also work for other forms of ginseng such as red and white. how to do it peel ginseng root into very thin slices. coat it with honey and let it sit for around 15 minutes. pour very hot not boiling water over coated ginseng and let it steep for at least five to 10 minutes. scoop out ginseng slices and enjoy. however black ginseng or any kind of ginseng comes with warning. ginseng is stimulant and using it constantly can lead to insomnia. to make most of its effects use it on cycle. pregnant women and those with existing medical conditions or those who are taking medication should consult

with iodine supplementation is essential for heart disease diabetes cancer. ,we knew hundred years ago that we needed more iodine and governments started putting tiny bit in table salt. it was not enough and after nuclear accident at fukushima we need more because of radioactive iodine released into environment. humans in 21st century have absolute need for iodine supplementation. iodine is only medicinal that stands between antibiotic resistant hell and us. there are many reasons we need iodine in abundance. there are three principle reasons however that stand out thrusting iodine into its place as medicine of supreme importance first is its antibiotic anti fungal and anti viral effects that go beyond antibiotics because it kills viruses which antibiotic do not. iodine kills fungus and yeast like candida which antibiotics do not. in addition it does it without creating antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. scientists are also finding that antibiotics are causing bacteria to grow faster instead of killing them so it is almost suicidal to not employ iodine as first line of defense in our fight against infections. salon magazine published over 95 percent of physicians are concerned about antibiotic resistance and that is all we need to know about iodine which everyone should have on hand in their homes for everyday use as well as emergencies. iodine has it all over antibiotics not only because it takes down viruses as well as fungus but also because it does not provoke bacteria to become resistant to it. though it kills 90 percent of bacteria on skin within 90 seconds its use as antibiotic has been tragically ignored. iodine exhibits activity against bacteria molds yeasts protozoa and many viruses indeed of all antiseptic preparations suitable for direct use on humans and animals and upon tissues only iodine is capable of killing all classes of pathogens gram positive and gram negative bacteria mycobacteria yeasts and protozoa. most bacteria are killed within 15 to 30 seconds of contact. in beginning of 2017 nearly three dozen people in united states have been diagnosed with deadly and highly drug resistant fungal infection that has been rapidly spreading around world. fungus strain of kind of yeast known as candida auris. unlike garden variety yeast infections this one causes serious bloodstream infections spreads easily from person to person in health care settings and survives for months on skin and for weeks on bed rails chairs and other hospital equipment. some strains are resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs. up to 60 percent of people with these infections have died. candida auris is not resistant to iodine. viral infections always have doctors scrambling because they have forgotten how effective iodine is against them. dr. richard kunin after fifty years of practice concluded that iodide destroys virus of herpes. both oral and genital lesions are treatable this way. dr. eliot dick observed 50 percent reduction in respiratory illnesses when using iodine. many reports by patients find that gargle of ten drops of potassium iodide in glass of water with or without additional vitamin c relieved sore throat in matter of hours. research at massachusetts general hospital tells us hiv was completely inactivated and could no longer replicate after exposure to povidone iodine preparations even at very low concentrations. second is its importance with prevention and treatment of cancer. iodine is indispensable in protecting against thyroid cancer breast cancer ovarium cancer as well as prostate cancer because all of these glands concentrate iodine more than other tissues. deficiencies in iodine leave these glands vulnerable. iodine also is indispensable for treating anything on skin even skin cancer mainly because it kills everything on contact that does not belong. breast tissue contains bodys third highest concentrations of this essential mineral so shortfalls in iodine needs have highly negative impact on breast tissue. iodine shortfalls coupled with bromine and other toxic halogens cause fibrocystic breast disease and breast cancer. high intake of iodine is associated with lower risk of breast cancer. low iodine intake is associated with liver cancer. iodine is ideal for treating skin cancer. these are just tip of iceberg in terms of how important iodine is for cancer patients. third is iodine is protective against radioactive iodine. we can not begin to understand how important this is until we also learn how dire threat is of radiation. dr. john w. gofman professor emeritus of molecular and cell biology in university of california at berkeley has written extensively about effort to belittle menace of low level radiation. people associated with nuclear and medical industries assert falsely there is no evidence that exposure to low dose radiation causes any cancerthe risk is only theoretical or risk is utterly negligible or accidental exposures were below safe level and even there is reasonably good evidence that exposure to low dose radiation is beneficial and lowers cancer rate. by any reasonable standard of scientific proof weight of human evidence shows decisively that cancer is inducible by ionizing radiation even at lowest possible dose and dose ratewhich means that risk is never theoretical. different isotopes of radioactive iodine one with incredibly long half life have been dumped into environment by fukushima meltdown. iodine deficient adults and children are sitting ducks to their radioactive cousins especially if they are eating milk and cheese because radioactive iodine gets into grass that cattle eat and it just goes up food chain to your door. fourth is absolute necessity of iodine in metabolism. human life is not possible without iodine. that truth is important to every cell in our bodies. fifth is its role in production of hormones. iodine helps synthesize thyroid hormones and prevents both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. iodine sufficiency reverses hypo- and hyperthyroidism. iodines ability to revive hormonal sensitivity seems to significantly improve insulin sensitivity. iodine attaches to insulin receptors and improves glucose metabolism. iodine is best nutritional support for your thyroid. your thyroid controls your metabolism and efficiency of your metabolism is directly related to that of your immune system.[1 sixth is its role in immune system. bodys ability to resist infection and disease is hindered by long term deficiency in iodine. poor immune response is directly tied in with impaired thyroid function deficiency in iodine can greatly affect immune system because low levels of iodine lead to problems with thyroid gland. iodine purifies water and it does same job on bloodstream. iodine purifies complete bloodstream of body something thyroid does every 17 minutes meaning sufficient levels of iodine especially in children keeps body free of pathogens no vaccines needed. iodines true role as clearly making up as much as 1/2 of bodys immune system has yet to be understood by doctors but should be as age of antibiotic resistant fungal resistant and viral medication resistant infections threaten human race. iodide is accumulated during phagocytosis process of engulfing and ingesting bacteria and other foreign bodies. iodide is attached to bacteria and to proteins creating iodoproteins including monoiodotyrosine t1. sometimes thyroid hormones are utilized as source of iodide. dr. gabriel cousens lists many other important functions of iodine. iodine offers dozens of under utilized applications and should always be included when treating or preventing disease. simply put there is no bacteria virus or other microorganism that can survive or adapt to iodine rich environment. 4 iodine activates hormone receptors and helps prevent certain forms of cancer. 11 iodine is needed with use of cordless phones cell phones and now smart meters to prevent hypothyroidism. 12 iodine supports pregnancy as fetus undergoes more apoptosis than any other developmental stage. 17 high doses of iodine may be used for wounds bedsores inflammatory and traumatic pain and restoration of hair growth when applied topically. 18 iodine helps in diminishing of tissue scarring cheloid formations and dupuytrens and peyronies contractures which are hyper scarring conditions. 19 high doses of iodine may be used to reverse certain diseases. i have always recommended liquid iodine in form of nascent iodine which i recommend for children and iodine sensitive patients who need to start at very low dosages and lugols iodine which has been around for almost two centuries. solid forms are available. by dr mark sircus author of healing with iodine your missing

carbohydrate diet.,if you re looking for alternative methods to naturally heal your type 2 diabetes for life then there s highly effective method for you to try. actual statistics for type 2 diabetes are shocking. worldwide there are now 347 million people who now have diabetes. 1 of these same people 90 of them suffer with type 2 diabetes. 1 world health organisation projects that diabetes deaths will increase by two thirds between 2008 and 2030 1. in united states diabetes affects 25.8 million people of all ages which is 8.3 of u.s. population 2. shocking as these figures are it is also other diseases and health issues that can affect many diabetics that is also great cause for concern. did you know that diabetes is leading cause of kidney failure non traumatic lower limb amputations and new cases of blindness among adults in united states as well as major cause of heart disease and strokes. 2 so what exactly is type 2 diabetes. type 2 diabetes or adult diabetes as it used to be call not so now as more and more children are now suffering from it is metabolic disorder where body becomes insulin resistant and is characterized by high level of glucose in blood. put simply hormone insulin which is produced by pancreas is required to transport sugars in our blood that we get from what we eat into your bodys cells where they can then be utilised. problem with type 2 diabetes happens when bodys cells begin to literally resist insulin hormone which is transporting sugars. this means sugar continues to circulate around blood instead of going straight into bodys cells and so pancreas produces even more insulin in effort to transport sugar glucose out of blood and into cells of body thus stressing pancreas. over long period of time this will have debilitating effect on pancreas due to it being stressed by over production of insulin. this will often result in less and less insulin being produced by pancreas and so need for more drugs medical intervention. other type of diabetes type 1 differs from type 2 in that insulin producing cells of pancreas are destroy by bodys own immune system known as autoimmune disease. as yet there is no known cure for type 1 diabetes where patients need to take insulin via medication though healthy lifestyle including diet can certainly help you improve type 1 diabetes. why do people get type 2 diabetes. within mainstream medical profession it is understood that there is no one single cause of type 2 diabetes and it is thought that persons chance of developing this disease is linked to several factors which include environmental factors such as exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals lifestyle factors such as being overweight obese lack of exercise and poor diet no doubt factors such as genetics and others listed do play part in deciding what diseases may affect you personally. yet people with type 2 diabetes have completely healed their condition with help of high carbohydrate plant based diet. so what exactly has standard diet got to do with type 2 diabetes. processed food fat and large amounts of it. many health professionals outside of mainstream now advocate around 10 fat or less to be truly healthy such as dr john mcdougall dr neal barnard and dr michael klaper to name just few. and reason is because they recognize that modern western diet as it is now has way too much fat including saturated animal fat which is well known for its many negative health effects. insulin and high fat intake do not go together well. consuming too much fat both animal and plant based fat and over loading body with it can lead to also sorts of health issues. one of these is when fat begins to interfere with process of sugar metabolism and brings on disease we know as type 2 diabetes. with sustained high fat intake cells of body begin to struggle with delivery of sugars via transport medium we know as hormone insulin. with excess fat coating cells and thus impairing this hugely important process disease we know as type 2 diabetes begins. many studies have been conducted over years that show high carbohydrate low fat plant based diet can make huge positive impact on health of people who are suffering with type 2 diabetes. for instance studies carried out by university of kentucky medical school reported that as many as two thirds of diabetics were able to discontinue with use of insulin and almost all of them stopped oral medication 3. another study found how low fat vegan diet improves glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. 4 studies tend to use low fat vegetarian diets to carry out their testing but you can do even better than this diet and that is switching to low fat vegan plan with lots of raw foods on menu. for example several of our clients and followers have actually reversed their type 2 diabetes completely by switching to fruit based raw or mostly raw food lifestyle. bibi zambrano came off her diabetes medication within 2 weeks after

received intriguing email claiming that rapidly increasing worldwide epidemic of diabetes was caused by depleted uranium du. as medical doctor i never heard of such idea. every physician knows that radiation can lead to cancer but du and diabetes connection seemed ludicrous. nevertheless i thought it would be interesting to check it out on internet. best tool for medical research on net is pubmed website sponsored by us national library of medicine. i typed in keywords depleted uranium and diabetes. no citations to scientific papers in medical journals appeared on my computer screen which further assured me there was no scientific connection. even when i used key words depleted uranium and human disease only mere 16 papers were cited on subject from 1994 to 2005 and only half these papers addressed medical problems of soldiers exposed to du in gulf war. what was revealed is that du accumulates in lymph nodes brain testicles and other organs and short term and long term effects of du were not known. there was definite increase of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to du and gulf war vets who inhaled du were still excreting abnormal amounts of uranium in urine 10 years later. why was there so little written about du and its effects on human body. having written extensively on man made epidemic of aids and its cover up for two decades i was not surprised. i strongly suspected research into health effects of du on gulf war veterans was politically incorrect. on other hand quick google internet search of side effects depleted uranium referred me to 71.000 english pages on web. when i added key word diabetes there were 22.000 pages. i also discovered that articles about health dangers of du rarely if ever appear in major media. in january 2001 press release fair fairness accuracy in reporting accused media of depleted coverage of depleted uranium weapons. nevertheless great deal of information on du can be found on internet. du was first used by us in 1991 gulf war then in balkans in late 1990s in kosovo in 2000 in war against afghanistan in iraq in 2003 and also by israelis in 2006 war with lebanon. needless to say us military and government officials totally deny any health danger from du. reassuring new york times article of 9 january 2001 entitled 1999 u.s. document warned of depleted uranium in kosovo by marlise simons noted while acknowledging hazards both pentagon and nato pointing to medical experts have denied any links could exist between exposure to depleted uranium and illness and deaths of veterans. du weapons were developed by us navy in 1968 and were first given to israel by us in 1973 arab israeli war. since then us has tested manufactured and sold du weapons systems to 29 countries. vieques island testing site in puerto rico was repeatedly bombarded with du in 1999 prior to its use in kosovo. du is byproduct of enriching of natural uranium for use in nuclear reactors. as nuclear waste du is costly to keep but relatively inexpensive to obtain. due to their tank armour piercing capabilities du weapons are extremely effective and reason why military is so enthralled with them. major doug rokke is leading du expert who has become whistleblower against its use. he claims each tank round is composed of 10 pounds of solid uranium-238 contaminated with plutonium neptunium and americium. round is pyrophoric meaning it generates intense heat on impact easily penetrating tank because of heavy weight of metal. when du munitions hit they produce firestorm inside any vehicle or structure resulting in devastating burns and injuries to those who escape immediate death and incineration. on impact du produces uranium oxide dust and pieces of uranium explode all over place. once inside body tiny nanoparticles enter lungs and blood stream and are carried throughout body. when rokke and his team were assigned to clean up du after first gulf war all his men got ill within 72 hours with respiratory problems rashes bleeding and open sores. in australian interview with gay alcorn in 2003 rokke admitted after everything i ve seen everything i ve done it became very clear to me that you ca nt take radioactive wastes from one nation and just throw it into another nation. its wrong. its simply wrong. according to asaf durakovic md of uranium medical research centre in washington dc term depleted uranium is misnomer. both depleted and natural uranium are over 99 composed of uranium 238. du is almost as highly concentrated as pure uranium and may contain plutonium deadly element in trace amounts. leuren moret is independent american scientist who works on radiation and health issues with communities around world. at age 61 she is leading activist against use of du having worked in two nuclear weapons labs including lawrence livermore national laboratory in berkeley california run by us department of energy. she is ultimate antigovernment whistleblower on du along with rokke and durakovic and all three have personally suffered including death threats for their anti du views. in her article depleted uranium trojan horse of nuclear war which appeared in june 2004 world affairs journal moret claims use of du weaponry by us defying all international treaties will slowly annihilate all species on earth including human species and yet this country continues to do so with full knowledge of its destructive potential. du travels. du radioactive particles are picked up by atmosphere and are transferred by wind storms and air currents. they permanently contaminate vast regions and slowly destroy genetic future of populations living in those areas. as trojan horse of nuclear war moret calls du weapon that keeps on killing. there is no way to turn it off and no way to clean it up. it meets us governments own definition of weapons of mass destruction. du has very high affinity for cellular dna and permanently damages it. du is fourth generation of nuclear weapons. first came atomic bomb then hydrogen bomb then neutron bombs and now du. moret claims contaminated du dust from middle east gets absorbed into atmosphere. via dust storms and air currents it ends up in europe and britain. eventually it spreads and get absorbed into atmosphere globally. there is no safe place no possible way to escape it. morets concerns are confirmed by 2006 report from england by chris busby and saoirse morgan appearing in european biology and bioelectromagnetics and titled did use of uranium weapons in gulf war 2 result in contamination of europe. data obtained with help of freedom of information act from atomic weapons establishment at aldermaston berkshire uk revealed that after nine days of shock and awe start of iraq war on 19 march 2003 much higher levels of uranium were picked up on five sites in berkshire. on two occasions levels exceeded threshold at which environment agency must be informed though still within safety limits. these levels were highest levels of depleted uranium ever measured in atmosphere in britain. report also confirmed weather conditions over this war period which showed consistent flow of air from iraq northwards. not surprisingly this research was vigorously denied as uranium of natural origin by various government officials. however busby and morgan insist findings are first evidence that du particles were able to travel thousands of miles from baghdad to england. their report can be found on internet. about 300 tons of du were dispersed over iraq in 1991. yet us department of defense dod has found little health risk to soldiers who inhaled du and continues to claim exposure to du is safe. nearly 580.000 soldiers were deployed in war. 294 soldiers died and 400 were wounded or became ill. as of year 2000 there were 325.000 on permanent medical disability and over 11.000 have died. obviously something serious happened to health of these men and women who served in gulf. du is known to be neurotoxic. gulf war vets are twice as likely to come down with als lou gehrigs disease than vets who did not serve in iraq. als fatal neuromuscular disease is now considered service connected disease and vets can get disability. gulf war vets have nearly twice prevalence of chronic multi system disease than soldiers who served elsewhere at same time. but so called gulf war syndrome continues to be denied as specific illness. department of defenses evaluation does not consider gws as unique syndrome unique illness or unique symptom complex in deployed gulf war vets. half century ago during early years of cold war when i went to medical school diabetes was not common disease. now in 21st century it is common to hear of diabetes as impending epidemic. certainly statistics bear this out. currently 7 of americans have diabetes 17 million. in addition los angeles times front page report on 16 september 2006 claims that there are more than 41 million americans with abnormal blood glucose abnormalities that indicate they may soon develop diabetes. in puerto rico where du was tested 10 of population has diabetes. centres of disease control cdc in atlanta declares that unless americans change their ways 33 of babies born this year will be diabetic by year 2050. also by 2050 there are expected to be 45 million diabetics in us. vet support group veterans with diabetes international says there are 143 million people worldwide with disease and 300 million people are expected to have diabetes in 2025. type 1 diabetes most often seen in children and young adults comprises 5 10 of cases. type 2 metabolic disorder resulting from bodys inability to make enough or properly use insulin frequently strikes adults especially obese adults. this group comprises 90 or more of diabetics. cdc predicts that type 2 diabetes will increase 165 by 2050. people with type 2 diabetes are also twice as likely to get pancreatic cancer. thirty four years after vietnam war ended dod finally presented strongest evidence that type 2 diabetes can be connected to agent orange. eighteen million gallons of this plant defoliant and poison was sprayed over vietnam by us military. it is now known to cause cancer and birth defects. starting in year 2002 diabetes is now recognised as service connected disease for all vietnam vets. at present diabetes is not service connected for gulf war vets. nine percent of vietnam vets have type 2 diabetes. there is no current evidence that gulf war vets have heightened incidence of diabetes but i could find no solid research to confirm or deny this. perhaps in one or two more decades government scientists will discover connection to du. common causes of diabetes are thought to be obesity poor diet and lack of exercise. leuren moret believes cause of new epidemic is more sinister namely increasing levels worldwide of depleted uranium in atmosphere combined with emissions from proliferation of nuclear power plants. unlike government scientists moret says du is very very very nasty stuff and that diabetes is immediate response to du in contrast to decades it can take for uranium to produce radiation induced cancer. although she can not prove it she is first scientist to strongly suggest connection between new worldwide diabetes epidemic and du. moret insists medical profession has been active in cover up of low level radiation from atmospheric testing and nuclear power plants. i have been unable to verify this but it is consistent with passive role health profession took during cold war nuclear testing in us more later. she has also spoken about medical professionals in hospitals who were threatened by government officials with 10.000 fines and jail time if they talked openly about returning iraq war soldiers and their medical problems. this could explain paucity of reports in scientific literature regarding vets exposed to du and their war associated illnesses. moret also says reporters have been prevented access to more than 14.000 medically evacuated soldiers from current iraq war brought back to walter reed hospital near washington dc. to learn more about leuren moret and her research google leuren moret videos. in addition she appears in recent documentary film beyond treason detailing horrific effects of depleted uranium exposure on american troops and iraqi civilians in gulf region in 1991. ronald l. kathren is professor emeritus at washington state university and leading authority vouching for safety of du. unlike major rokke he does not appear to have ever served in military or to have come in contact with du on battlefield. nevertheless his opinions carry lot of weight in scientific world. kathren does not dispute fact that military personnel who may have had contact with du are suffering from various illnesses but he believes that exposure to uranium is very unlikely to be cause. writing for portland independent media centre on 3 july 2005 he declares health physicists are deeply concerned with public health and welfare and as experts in radiation and its effects on people and environment are quite aware that something other than exposure to uranium is cause of illnesses suffered by those who have had contact with depleted uranium from munitions. truly enormous body of scientific data shows that it is virtually impossible for uranium to be cause of their illnesses. despite this body of scientific data to contrary misguided or unknowing people continue to allege that depleted uranium and specifically radioactivity associated with depleted uranium is cause of these illness. this is indeed unfortunate for health physicists and other scientists and physicians already know that depleted uranium is not cause of these illnesses and thus any investigations into cause of these illnesses should focus on other possible causes. if we are to offer any measure of relief or solace to these suffering people and to gain some important additional knowledge of cause of their illness we should not waste our valuable and limited energies resources and time attempting to point finger at depleted uranium as culprit when it is already known that uranium is almost certainly not cause of problem. reference no level of radiation is safe for humans as physician it is inconceivable to me that government approved experts like kathren can so quickly dismiss du as safe and harmless particularly when on 29 june 2005 national academy of sciences panel in washington dc has found that no level of radiation is safe for humans. panel concluded that any dose of radiation no matter how small can induce cancer. exposure to radiation is becoming more and more likely for most people because of growing use of radiation in medicine. new findings could lead to changes in medical practices and levels of radiation allowed at former nuclear sites. panel also contradicted often heard dictum of some government pro nuclear scientists that little radiation is good for you. idea that low doses of radiation are safe is myth that allowed extensive nuclear testing during cold war without huge protest from every member of human race. it is this myth that still allows du weapons to be used on battlefields against terrorists. historically proof of danger of nuclear warfare was provided decade ago by publication of us congressional committee report authorised by president bill clinton and entitled human radiation experiments. report showed clearly that government scientists and physicians could not be trusted in their pronouncements regarding safety of nuclear weapons. even worse was documentation of countless covert and secret radiation experiments conducted on unsuspecting citizens during cold war in name of science. unfortunately this horrific 1996 report did not deter clinton from allowing du weapons in kosovo in 1999 nor did it deter president george w. bush who authorised their use again in afghanistan and iraq. anyone with internet access can simply google human radiation experiments for details of shameful science surrounding nuclear testing and disastrous health effects on unsuspecting american citizens. in 2001 half century after extensive nuclear weapons testing in american west us national cancer institute was finally forced to reveal its finding that bomb testing in nevada which spread radioactive fallout across every state of union has caused at least 15.000 cancer deaths and up to 212.000 non fatal thyroid cancers. john laforge of nukewatch.com reminds us that 67 bomb tests blown off between 1946 and 1958 were said at time to be safe. who is profiting from this global uranium nightmare. in enemy within 1996 jay gould reveals that british royal family privately owns investments in uranium holdings worth over 6 billion through rio tinto mines anglo australian company which is worlds largest mining company with more than 60 operations in 40 countries. africa and australia are two of main sources of uranium in world and rothschilds control uranium supplies and prices globally. gould notes that nuclear radiation has brought dramatic increases in breast cancer mortality especially in communities 50 to 100 miles downwind from nuclear reactors. enemy within has enough scientific data to address those bureaucrats who deny that living near nuclear reactor is hazard to ones health. it also includes enough direct clear prose to convince me breast cancer survivor that i grew up during cold war as unknowing guinea pig further victimised by politics of suppression and denial. after reading book however i am bothered by one persistent question. i was born and raised and continue to live in san francisco california which has highest incidence of breast cancer in world. enemy within concerns itself with breast cancer mortality rates which are highest in communities around new york city. san francisco is nt within 100 miles of nuclear reactor and it is nt even mentioned in book. if low level radiation explains clusters of breast cancer throughout us what explains us. actually there was nuclear power plant located in sacramento less than 100 miles from san francisco which became active in 1975. gould probably did not include this in his 1996 book because rancho seco nuclear power plant was forced to shut down its operations in 1989 due to public outcry and referendum. david bradbury says child cancer rates on vieques island have soared 250 above puerto rican national average in last thirty years. in his 2005 documentary film blowin in wind provocative australian filmmaker and two time academy award nominee also provides some answers regarding huge financial interests involved in uranium production and du weapons. australia provides one third of worlds uranium supply and bradbury reveals secret treaty that allows us military to train and test its du weaponry on australian soil. he exposes plans to extract over 36 billion from uranium mines over next six years and shows finished construction of 1.000 mile railway from mining area to port on north coast of australia to transport ore. railway project was built by texas based halliburton company. in 1995 us vice president dick cheney was ceo of that company. queens favourite american buccaneers cheney halliburton and bush family are tied to her through uranium mining and shared use of illegal depleted uranium munitions in middle east central asia and kosovo bosnia. major roles that such diverse individuals and groups as carlyle group george herbert walker bush former carlyle ceo frank calucci university of california managed nuclear weapons labs at los alamos and livermore and us and international pension fund investments have played in proliferating depleted uranium weapons is not well known or in most instances even recognised inside or outside australia. god save queen from guilt of her complicity in turning planet earth into death star. uk queen in depleted uranium trade her fortune is 17 billion depleted uranium and war on terror there is nothing more terrifying than thought of exposing all life forms on planet to dna altering radiation in order to provide us with safety and democracy. it is truly diabolic to think that destruction of planet is now occurring with so few people comprehending what is going on and still fewer people taking active stand against this tragedy. it is apparent that most of worlds political and spiritual leaders as well as scientists physicians lawyers and health professionals do not care about dangers of du weapons and other forms of nuclear energy. if they cared we would certainly be hearing and reading about it on television and in major media. as researcher and writer over part few decades i have focused on man made origin of aids and little known bacterial cause of cancer paying little attention to nuclear radiation. however in 2001 i wrote article entitled human radiation experiments how scientists secretly used us citizens as guinea pigs during cold war which was published in september october 2001 issue of new dawn and is posted on several websites. but i must admit i was unaware of serious planetary problems posed by du. i simply assumed that no civilised and peace loving country would ever be reckless and heartless enough to use these radioactive weapons. how wrong i was. what i find most pathetic and inconceivable is that we have learned nothing from detrimental health effects unleashed by atomic bombing of japan and nothing from nuclear testing horrors of last half of 20th century. instead we continue to contaminate vast areas of world with radiation we do nt know how to get rid of. i remember as eleven year old boy how jubilant everyone was by atomic attack on hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 which brought war to rapid end. half century later my caucasian niece married japanese american man. shortly after wedding she noticed lump in his neck which proved to be thyroid cancer. his mother was child when she lived 50 miles outside of hiroshima when bomb was dropped. decades later in her forties she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer undoubtedly due to radiation fallout. doctors considered possibility that my nieces husband might have developed thyroid cancer because of radiation altered and thyroid cancer causing genes passed on to him by his mother. of course family wonders if their two young children will eventually also get thyroid cancer. who would have thought that atomic bombing of japan in 1945 would have cancerous effect five decades later on my family living in california. few years ago i developed thyroid nodule which was biopsied and proved non cancerous. as teenager in 1950s i received superficial radiation treatments for acne at recommendation of well known new york dermatologist treatment that was later banned because of its potential to cause thyroid cancer. it is almost clich to remind people that all of us are connected. fallout from du and nuclear energy now binds us all together in increasingly radioactive planet. no one is immune from deleterious effects of radiation and no one knows how to clean it up. what can we do about it. only thing we can do is to stop madness immediately. however power and greed and politics and religion make that highly unlikely. we have met perpetrators of new radiation induced war on terror. and sadly it is us. uranio 238 documentary part 1 copyright new dawn magazine http://www.newdawnmagazine.com. if you appreciated this article please consider digital subscription to new dawn.,recently i received intriguing email claiming that rapidly increasing worldwide epidemic of diabetes was caused by depleted uranium du. as medical doctor i never heard of such idea. every physician knows that radiation can lead to cancer but du and diabetes connection seemed ludicrous. nevertheless.

news.,naturalhealth365 according to u.s. government health statistics over 30 million adults in united states are living with type 2 diabetes. and astounding one third of all american adults will have developed disease by year 2050 if current trends continue. yet most people remain uninformed about link between low magnesium and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. now new study shows that getting sufficient magnesium not only helps prevent diabetes but improves blood sugar levels in individuals who already have condition. unfortunately most americans do nt consume recommended daily amount of this essential mineral. studies have shown that magnesium supplementation in those who have low magnesium can help reduce insulin resistance major factor in development of type 2 diabetes. blood sugar glucose levels normally increase after meals. job of insulin hormone produced in pancreas is to escort glucose from bloodstream into cells. if blood sugar levels remain too high over time body tries to address problem by secreting too much insulin which eventually causes insulin receptors on cells to stop responding. as more and more insulin is secreted and insulin receptors continue to ignore it blood sugar levels rise higher and higher and type 2 diabetes is result. heres where magnesium or lack of it fits into picture. for appropriate response of insulin receptors to insulin sufficient levels of magnesium are required. but in classic vicious cycle elevated insulin levels cause excessive amounts of magnesium to be excreted leaving mineral needed to manage insulin in first place in even shorter supply. in placebo controlled study published in diabetes metabolism researchers set out to examine efficacy of magnesium supplementation in reducing blood sugar levels in prediabetic adults with magnesium deficiencies. prediabetes is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels that do not meet clinical threshold for diabetes. if untreated prediabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes. participants were divided into two groups with one group receiving 382 mg of magnesium per day and other receiving placebo. team found that blood sugar levels in magnesium group decreased significantly along with triglycerides or fats in blood. levels of beneficial hdl cholesterol on other hand rose substantially. ultimately half of all participants in magnesium group significantly improved their blood sugar levels. in addition there s even more research that showcases benefits of magnesium for diabetes. in one study patients with type 2 diabetes and low magnesium received 500 mg day of magnesium chloride for 16 weeks and experienced significant reductions in fasting glucose along with normalization of blood levels of magnesium. other studies have shown that risk of type 2 diabetes plummets by 19 percent for every 100 mg increase in magnesium intake per day. upon being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes individual has four- to seven fold increase in risk of developing pancreatic cancer within three years. disturbing fact is 80 percent of time patients with pancreatic cancer have diabetes prediabetes or some form of glucose intolerance when diagnosed. and here pair of eye opening statistics that truly highlight need for sufficient magnesium levels. for every 100-mg drop in magnesium intake per day risk of developing pancreatic cancer goes up by 24 percent. and individuals with intake less than 75 percent of rda have 76 percent higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer when compared to those with optimal intake. institutes of medicine advise that women consume 320 mg of magnesium day while men should get 420 mg. in addition to regulating blood sugar magnesium helps to synthesize protein control blood pressure and build bone. it is also essential for proper nerve heart and muscle function. and deficiencies in magnesium are associated with raised risk of migraine osteoporosis and stroke as well as with risk of insulin resistance and pancreatic cancer. obviously you ca nt afford to be lacking in this essential mineral. yet experts say that most people in united states do nt get enough magnesium from dietary sources resulting in magnesium inadequacy magnesium intake that falls below rda but above amount that causes overt deficiency. older adults are particularly at risk for magnesium inadequacy. not only are they more likely to have diseases that lower magnesium they are also more likely to take magnesium depleting medications such as diuretics. experts report that magnesium content of soil has been declining steadily over past sixty years due to modern commercial farming techniques which rely heavily on nitrogen phosphorus and potassium. although these minerals are needed by plants in order to produce chlorophyll they can also compete with magnesium for absorption. how can i avoid shortfalls of magnesium. you can boost your dietary magnesium intake be eating healthy amounts of organic green leafy vegetables along with nuts seeds legumes and whole grains. nutrition tip foods that are high in natural fiber also tend to be high in magnesium. if you feel that you still may be low in magnesium you may want to consider supplementation. of course check with your integrative physician before supplementing. high doses of magnesium can cause diarrhea and cramping and megadoses can be dangerous. note no need to worry about obtaining excess magnesium from foods however. excess dietary magnesium is simply excreted. if you choose to supplement be aware that not all forms of magnesium are created equal. for instance studies have shown that magnesium citrate magnesium chloride and magnesium lactate are absorbed more completely than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate. takeaway when it comes to avoiding chronic life threatening diseases maintaining optimal levels of magnesium is one of most advantageous things you can do especially if you are of mature years.,naturalhealth365 according to u.s. government health statistics over 30 million adults in united states are living with type 2 diabetes. and astounding one third of all american adults will have developed disease by year 2050 if current trends

found natural whole food for treatment of type ii diabetes without inducing any side effects some studies suggested type ii diabetes is chronic acquired medical condition characterized by insufficient insulin entering bloodstream to regulate glucose. disease is either caused by cells in pancreas dying off or receptor sites clogged up by fat and cholesterol. in some cases diabetes is also caused by allergic reactions of cells in immune system. exact cause of type ii diabetes is unknown. however some researchers suggested that condition is most likely caused by genetic mutation and unhealthy lifestyle. other risk factors associated with early onset of type ii diabetes include overweight or obese age 45 or older family history ethnicity alaska native high blood pressure and cholesterol and women with polycystic ovary syndrome. dr. waqas sami lead author in study effect of diet on type 2 diabetes mellitus review wrote. dietary habits and sedentary lifestyle are major factors for rapidly rising incidence of dm among developing countries. in type 2 diabetics recently elevated hba1c level has also been considered as one of leading risk factors for developing microvascular and macrovascular complications and improvement in elevated hba1c level can be achieved through diet management thus patients could be prevented from developing diabetes complications. awareness about diabetes complications and consequent improvement in dietary knowledge attitude and practices lead to better control of disease. these results suggested changes in diet and lifestyle are most

due to its health benefits. aloe vera has been used in herbal medicine in treating many kinds of disease including wound burn healing minor skin infections sebaceous cysts diabetes and elevated of cholesterol etc .. chemical ingredients ten main areas of chemical constituents of aloe vera include amino acids anthraquinones enzymes minerals vitamins lignins monosaccharide polysaccharides salicylic acid saponins and sterols. in study to examine clinical effectiveness of aloe vera popular herbal remedy in united kingdom for treatment of type ii diabetes researchers at university of exeter launched review by researching database of medline embase biosis and cochrane library. only controlled clinical trials on any indication were included in study. there were no restrictions on language of publication. all trials were read and data were extracted in standardized pre defined manner. after differentiating 10 selected studies researchers found that oral administration of aloe vera might be useful adjunct for lowering blood glucose in diabetic patients as well as for reducing blood lipid levels in patients with hyperlipidemia. however topical application of aloe vera was not effective preventative for radiation induced injuries. furthermore dr. okyar and colleagues in clarifying controversy over past 15 years on hypoglycemic activity of aloe species launched investigation with separate experiments on three main groups of rats namely non diabetic nd type i iddm and type ii niddm diabetic rats. at end of experiment researchers found that application of aloe vera a. vera leaf pulp and gel extracts were ineffective on lowering blood sugar level of nd rats. a. vera leaf pulp extract showed hypoglycemic activity on iddm and niddm rats effect being enhanced for type ii diabetes in comparison with glibenclamide. on contrary a. vera leaf gel extract showed hyperglycaemic activity on niddm rats. these results suggested pulps of aloe vera leaves devoid of gel could be useful in treatment of non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. taken all together aloe vera may be considered adjunct therapy for treatment in patients non insulin dependent type 2 diabetes. however due to limitation of above studies additional data collection large example size and multi centers studies performed with human consumption of whole food aloe vera during course of

1513537,1,https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-11-12-chemicals-linked-to-obesity-type-2-diabetes.html,2019-11-12T08:51:32.000Z,naturalnews.com,7,chemicals used in common consumer items linked to higher obesity and type 2 diabetes risk study.,natural news if you have unhealthy lifestyle its not that surprising to find yourself suffering from obesity and type 2 diabetes but that s not only way you can develop these health problems. new study has shown that some of everyday products you use in your home could also be stacking odds against you when it comes to type 2 diabetes and obesity. researchers from serbias university of novi sad looked at levels of phthalates that are absorbed by people in study. these chemicals are regularly used during production process of plastics and they ve been found in items such as food packaging makeup shampoo bottled water instant coffee milk and perfume. after comparing phthalate absorption to peoples body weight diabetes status and liver and metabolic function they discovered that those whose exposure is greater had higher indicators for insulin resistance cholesterol and liver damage. these issues have all been linked to higher risk of diabetes obesity and heart disease. researchers believe that more awareness and action is needed when it comes to reducing peoples exposure to these common chemicals. this finding adds to past research showing that these chemicals are linked to fertility and development problems. for example one study from university of california berkeley found that endocrine disrupting chemicals like phthalates found in many conventional toothpastes soaps and shampoos are damaging hormones in children. they said that young girls are hitting puberty earlier than ever thanks to exposure to these endocrine disruptors while boys are also experiencing drops in testosterone as result of using these products. according to researchers exposure to these chemicals in personal care products has been bringing down average age at which girls reach puberty from 11 to 8. in addition to phthalates they identified phenols and parabens as risky thanks to their ability to mimic hormones within human body. when products are rubbed on skin or used orally these chemicals can make their way into body. they are also damaging to hormones of children who are exposed to them while in womb. this study which appeared in human reproduction journal was based on data from 338 children who were followed from pre birth through adolescence. another endocrine disrupting plastic chemical bpa has also been linked to obesity especially in children. this chemical was widely used in products like water bottles plastic food containers cutlery and childrens sippy cups where it can leach into food and drinks that are stored inside. problem is even greater when foods or drinks are heated frozen or left in sun or containers are scratched. although lots of products these days bear labels flaunting their bpa free status environmental working group reports that more than 16.000 products are currently on market containing bpa. while fda in u.s. has said that products with bpa are safe its use in making baby bottles has been banned for several years in european union and canada. how can you avoid plastics in everyday life. it seems like everything we do these days raises our risk of cancer and it can be very frustrating trying to keep track of what s safe and what is not. glass containers are safer bet than plastic for storing foods and beverages. when it comes to personal care products good rule of thumb is to go as natural as possible. instead of commercial lotions and shampoos consider moisturizing with natural shea butter or cocoa butter and washing your hair with homemade shampoos made of natural ingredients so you can avoid disease causing chemicals.,
